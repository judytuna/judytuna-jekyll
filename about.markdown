i'm playing Starcraft II, [learning](http://forum.learnnavi.org/) Na'vi, [singing](http://spottheoctop.us) a cappella, and having a good time.

I'm almost efamous! [http://www.gomtv.net/2011gslsponsors3/photos/65180](http://www.gomtv.net/2011gslsponsors3/photos/65180)!

**On Steam:** [judytuna](http://steamcommunity.com/id/judytuna) & here are my [screenshots](http://steamcommunity.com/id/judytuna/screenshots)

**On Kul Tiras:** Hug, 80 tauren resto druid. Vanadium, 80 orc tank DK. Prejudice, 80 undead disc priest. Hooloovoo, 68ish troll mage and superintelligent shade of the color blue. Plus several others, like thank you ants, Thants.

**On Dragonmaw:** Lynne was my 60 human paladin back in the day, but she's Bryht on Tich now. I may transfer her back soon. Lynnet is a new baby dwarf shaman, and Astix is my 74ish gnome warlock.
