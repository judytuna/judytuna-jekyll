I'm in Boston! Ion+Pammy.

Tried Rent the Runway for the first time-it's a neat service, and very easy to use. Ended up not wearing the dress I chose because it was rather more bootylicious than I wanted.

Yesterday, we biked along the esplanade and gazed upon the salt and pepper bridge. Made a pilgrimage to Grendel's. Watched the re-staging of a 20-year-old picture in front of a dome. Learned a bit about favorite boston haunts. Boggled over a giant bust of Fiedler made of aluminum sheets, and over a gleeful dog chasing Canada geese. Took pictures with Make Way For Ducklings. And had dinner with Annie at the Legal Test Kitchen, where they have things like truffled lobster mac and cheese, and mezcal drinks.

I'm having a lovely time here. We fly home tomorrow, after a trip to the Boston science museum.
