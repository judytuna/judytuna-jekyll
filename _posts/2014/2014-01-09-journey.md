      Is that a movie? Or a game? Or possibly the name of a puppy? Journey would be a cool name for a puppy.

I just played [Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_(2012_video_game)) for the first time. Played it all the way through. I can't tell you why I just cried for twenty minutes after the credits and watching the sunrise in the new journey screen, because I don't know why, myself.
