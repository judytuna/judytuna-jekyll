I went to the Chinatown NEMS location today for my appointment to enroll in [Healthy San Francisco](http://www.healthysanfrancisco.org/). While I was there, I stopped by the medical records desk & the radiology clinic (conveniently (for me) located on the same floor!) to get a copy of my xrays from my appointment with them two months ago. I’m going to bring them to the specialist I have an appointment with at the [Arbor Free Clinic](http://arbor.stanford.edu/) on Father’s day. No brunch for you! Only slow-healing ankles! 

NEMS Radiology gave me the xrays on a CD. I popped it in to my Mac and found a bunch of .exes and stuff, which I guess I can click on haphazardly when I turn on my Windows box later, but I did find a folder with just regular ol’ .jpg files. Three of my left foot, and three of my ankle.

There’s also a copy of what the radiologist said. Here it is, with links provided by me:

There are two tiny [ossific](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/ossific) foci seen near the [distal](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location#Proximal_and_distal) tip of the [medial malleolus](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Malleolus#Medial_malleolus) suspicious for [avulsion fracture](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Avulsion_fracture)s. The visualized [osseous](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Osseous_tissue) and [soft](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Soft_tissue) tissues, otherwise, appear unremarkable. There is no [dislocation](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Joint_dislocation).

Words I don’t know! Thank you, internet! Thank you especially, wikipedia! Thepedia. 

I feel pretty sorry for myself. =(
