done up till 3rd verse, which means i still have to do the third verse (bass drops out, sop is high, quick A-E danas for the altos, bass comes back in partway), third chorus (bass drops out again, i think only the girls sing here), fourth chorus (everything is very very loud, add lots of other parts for the violins that come in), and the two last bridges (second and third). second bridge is easy, just copy and paste from first bridge, but last bridge has a lot more going on, add more parts.)

then decide if i want to notate percussion (probably not, don't have time), and ... add lyrics/syllables in (maybe not even that, since no time, i might end up hand writing the syllables), and off to a copy center with me!
