maiki [posted](interi.org/2013/08/bartle-test/) about the [Bartle Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_Test), which shows what your preferences are in MMOs. I came out SEAK.

1. Socializer 73%
2. Explorer 67%
3. Achiever 40%
4. Killer 20%

I am not that surprised by this. I have some quibbles, because I don't consider many of the questions to be actual choices. For example, one of the questions asks you if you'd rather explore a new zone or a kill a monster. What if you have to kill a monster in order to explore a new zone?
