There's a guy outside my window. Usually, when people say that, they mean "standing on the street" or "in the next building." No. This guy is on a ladder and I can see the details in his belt because it is 2 inches away from the glass. I guess he is fixing the light. I just adjusted a little imperfection in my blinds so that he can't see in (and so that I can't see him anymore) but to close my windows I'd have to move the blinds more. I pout. I hope he likes Muse, cuz that's what I'm playing at full volume to drown out how much those girls want to be DGs o yes o yes o yes they do.

Edit 2:43pm: they added choreo to sweeter than a honeybee. I'll perform it for you the next time I see you.
