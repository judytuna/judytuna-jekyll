What happened in math on Thursday (even AFTER the "short quiz" that melted all our faces):

Seriously, this girl raised her hand and said "I don't want to hear about your tangents--" and the professor cut her off and said "I have been teaching this course for 18 years--" and the girl cut him off and said "Well then, let's take a vote. Who here wants to listen to him go off on how stupid we are and who wants to learn--" at which point the professor said "Vote? Vote? There will be no such thing. The discussion is ending here. If you don't like how I teach, then you can complain, or go be a math professor yourself." Then she circulated a petition that said "We, the undersigned, would rather the professor talk about matters directly related to the course material, instead of insulting his students' intelligence and going on wild tangents about super-string theory that require a background that most of us do not have to understand." Three people signed it. Three other people wrote little paragraphs saying that they enjoyed the tangents and did not agree with the petition. The other 25 of us didn't do anything.

ZOMG DRAMA

Anyway, I then discovered Sami, 113's GSI, and her office hours, and she is very nice and friendly and lively and talks loudly and is smart and pretty and I am very glad to have someone like her who can help us. Because we are all very bewildered.

I just spilled water all over my notebook. It is soggy. As cornflakes.

After that highly bewildering morning, I went to my Faulkner seminar professor's office hours. I'm still on the waitlist for that class, but she said "What? I thought we enrolled you... well, even if we have to go to 26 to enroll you, I will. I value your participation in class." I WIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I really like this class. [babygrand](http://babygrand.livejournal.com/) will remember how when we took 45c and read "the sound and the fury" I kept telling her how much I loved the appendix and how brutally sarcastic the whole thing was. Yeah. I really like it.
