![What Flavour Are You? I taste like Menthol.](http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/flavour/11.png)I taste like **Menthol**.

I am refreshingly different; some people don't appreciate that. My sharp honesty gets up some people's noses, while others really enjoy it. I am something of an acquired taste. [What Flavour Are You?](http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/flavour.pl)

it adds that if i were not menthol i would be tomato which is "I taste like nothing, except a tomato. I'm sometimes sweet and sometimes tart; sometimes juicy, sometimes crisp. The roles of a tomato are many and varied. I am an exception to all the rules." 

heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. man, i love these stupid little personality quizzes. what a wonderful waste of time.
