today i did not fall asleep in class. i did all of my homework and turned it in. hooray. my gsi is gautam. i asked him how to pronounce his name and he replied that it rhymes with autumn, but it might sound weird with an american accent. accents are cool. british accents are cool. he says "lemmar" and "co-RO-llary." corolla. is corolla a word, or just the name of the car? is it the root of corollary?

ryan and i have been playing much warcraft iii. i used to always beat him, but today he beat me twice! ahh!!! i think i stopped getting better a long time ago. hmmm. i will dream of night elves.
