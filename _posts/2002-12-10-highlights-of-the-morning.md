around 8am, joan says "hey judy, wanna go for breakfast?"
around 8:30, we stroll into starbucks. i get a chai tea.
around 8:45 or so, we stroll into bongo burger, because joan has always wanted to try their breakfast. "they have eggs and shit." we both get mushroom omlette (which comes with toast, jam, and homefries) and joan gets a side of bacon. mmm bacon. we eat. 
we converse. upon such illuminating topics as berkeley high school kids, how college kids always look tired, rod stewart's "forever young." i swear i heard joan hum along to no doubt's "don't speak" but only for a little while. i hear celine dion's "new day" or whatever that song is and i remember my dim urges to arrange that song. 
the omlette was yummy! the homefries were yummy! (bits of potato with bits of onions and bits of green bell pepper.) yay bongo burger! yay breakfast!

last night listened to josh groban cd. joan said it calmed her down. me too. thanks jenny for reminding me of his existence. i like his voice. sometimes i feel un-purist-y in that josh groban is crossing over to pop and it's not "real" "opera" or "classical" music or "whatever," but i really "don't" care and "who" am i "kidding" because i like "pop" "anyway" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so yeah! 

sometimes i forget i own a boombox thing and cds. i've remembered again recently. i like it.

please, oh please, oh please get me this for christmas: http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1943585983 or maybe just this http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1943781814 , since i don't REALLY need 8 color faceplates... you know... but it would be nice...
