http://www.ecologycenter.org/recycling/index.html !

I always used to recycle my yogurt containers. Woops. And no #3, 4, 5, 6, 7 plastics! I just threw out like half the things in my "to recycle" box. I also didn't know they don't want us to put the paper in the same blue bin as the glass/plastics. No wonder it wasn't picked up a few weeks ago -.-

Happy chinese new year, people.
