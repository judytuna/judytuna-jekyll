big caucasian guy just looked in, saw me at the computer, opened the door and said "konichiwa." i said "hello" and he raised his eyebrows, looked back at his friend, and said "hello?" pointing at me, obviously surprised that i spoke english. i said "i'm from america" by way of explanation and i can't imagine i said it in a very friendly manner. he said "you go to sleep now arigato" (in fake asian accented broken english). don't think he works here, just wanted to talk to other hostel residents i guess.

sharon mentioned that some storekeepers thought she was japanese too. i've only had 1 person in a store greet me in japanese (i assume she asked me if i wanted a basket cuz she was offering a basket). never underestimate the power of body language... ha!

i tried to talk to a lady today at the bus stop who pointed at herself and said "japanese." then she said my face looked japanese haha.
