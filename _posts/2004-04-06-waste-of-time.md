 You know you love it. [says K]

1: Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says:
not even distinguish the sky. The fiery stripe of an express
(King, Queen, Knave, Vladimir Nabokov)

2: Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?
IKEA Tromso loft bed post. They're ubiquitous.

3: What is the last thing you watched on TV?
Does season 2 of 24 on Ryan's powerbook count? OMG I NEARLY DIED AFTER WATCHING SEASON 2'S LAST EPISODE

4: WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what the time is:
3

5: Now look at the clock, what is the actual time?:
2:41(am)

6: With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?:
nothing. I'd say something like "Just the roaring cacophony in my head, like usual," but then I'd have to write a poem with the word "glimmer" in it for K.

7: When did you last step outside? What were you doing?:
3:20pm, going with R to the BART station to say bye

8: Before you came to this website, what did you look at?:
http://bitpim.sourceforge.com

9: What are you wearing?:
Favorite pair of old pale ck jeans (my mom recently put a patch on the hole in the cuff!). Purple flower shirt. Cal sweatshirt. Grey stripey underwear. Pink bra. Glasses. Watch. Onion taste in mouth from leftovers.

10: Did you dream last night?:
Probably, but I don't remember. Anxious

11: When did you last laugh?:
Does this count? ryangiraffe (2:42:40 AM): i'm loving this 80s music

r (2:42:55 AM): michael jackson
j (2:44:04 AM): hehe =) you are cute. 

12: What is on the walls of the room you are in?:
Ok. West: Two O'Neill posters. 
North: shelf (not even going to go into any detail). Colorful cross (I was told once before what the name of the style is, but I forgot. There's a larger one of that style on the wall of the Emmaus room at Newman). Two "I Touched the Future/ Touch Screen Voting/ Alameda County, CA" stickers. Wire rack with assorted necklaces/keychains/stampbooks/notes. Postcard. Wrapping paper. Chinese calligraphy from my mom including the word fish (I don't remember what proverb it is). Picture of angela c, me, emily, and [krdogstar](http://krdogstar.livejournal.com/) right before a bsb concert. 
East: Picture of R at Yuba river on the bridge. Four Warcraft III mousepads in a line from top to bottom: UD, Orc, Hu, NE. Cutouts of stylized horse paintings from New Fashion Hair Design's free 2003 calendar in a row across the top. (That's the place that my entire family has gotten haircuts from for the last 6 years or so). CD-shelf. Mini IKEA shelf nailed to wall and propped up on top of the blinds. Corkboard attached to wall via wire and pushpin containing photos and embarrasing magazine cutouts assembled my freshman year in the dorms. 
South: Connie's shelf thing.

13: Seen anything weird lately?:
Yeah, the log documenting all the BitPim errors.
