i just cleaned up my machine's startup programs with the help of http://www.pacs-portal.co.uk/startup_index.htm, a truly wonderful site. my computer has always started up pretty quickly, but now i don't have to sit around and wait for five years for useless programs to load after it starts up (like the fifty million programs that enable the (many! useless!) buttons on my overly complicated logitech keyboard/mouse). aaand my task list, which used to be totally bloated, now only has three things. yeah, there are task-list lists out there too, like http://www.answersthatwork.com/Tasklist_pages/tasklist.htm, which was superbly useful in telling me how to get rid of Rnathchk (goddamn realone player!), which kept randomly loading up and making my computer lag during warcraft. uncluttered vaio = unlagging warcraft = happy judy.
