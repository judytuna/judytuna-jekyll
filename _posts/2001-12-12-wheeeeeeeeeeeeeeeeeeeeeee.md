i went to moffitt at 4pm yesterday, after getting lunch at gypsy's with sandy. i stayed in moffit, with the exception of the time between 8 and 9pmish, until ... just now. there were a surprising amount of people still there all night. of these, a not very surprising 40% were sleeping. yeah i slept for a while, from at least 6 to 8:30am. WHEEEEEEEEEE

i am a failure as an essay writer.

but you must fail before you succeed. i'm not ditching the prospect of English yet. i'll get better, you just watch. yes. watchin the dandelions grow. fuckin school.
