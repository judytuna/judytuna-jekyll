I’m helping Jamal at [Eudemonia](http://community.eudemonia.net) with a League of Legends fan podcast! It’s called [25 Minutes To Surrender](http://25minstosurrender.podomatic.com) and it’s tons of fun. Jamal is doing a great job of pulling everyone together (read: lighting fires under our butts) and generating show content. Our other regular cast members are Aaron, Will T, Razvan, Greg, Chi, and Kyle F. 

Every week, we go over the free champions, picking a few and highlighting their current metagame viability. We move on to many varied topics of interest to new players all the way up to experienced ones. In the past couple of episodes, we’ve covered drafting/teambuilding/countering strategies, items, silly things like new skins, jungling strategies and champions…

Every other week, we have a special guest on the show. [Faro](http://www.youtube.com/leaguetopten) actually came to the store and hung out; [Elementz](http://www.reignofelementz.com) and [RiotPhreak](http://www.youtube.com/riotgamesinc) called into the show via Skype. These interviews are tons of fun. I learn a LOT… a lot a lot a lot. Phreak gave us some leaks too, and insight on how Riot does balancing and is committed to e-sports and such.

Someone that is not me [posted about us](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ebb0o/25_minutes_to_surrender_podcast_weekly_lol_podcast/) on reddit already, commending our sound quality. This makes me happy in the pants.

I also just posted 25MTS to [teamliquid](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=172472) (the premier english-language starcraft 2 forum) because they just created a subform for league of legends. 

We might be able to interview Brackhar, the designer of Anivia, Taric, Janna, and Nidalee. He [responded to me](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ec0cd/im_a_game_designer_on_league_of_legends_ama/c17532p?context=3) on his AMA. His AMA is really great–there are some really good questions and answers.
