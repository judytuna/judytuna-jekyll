1. my registration block was cleared. in bearfacts, it says "released."
2. i can sign up for classes via telebears just fine.
3. but bearfacts also says student has no fees due this term and no statement was sent asking for money.

= strange. slightly worrisome. too late in the day, perhaps, to do anything about it now; will call tomorrow morning i suppose.
