      <p>uh oh... that's what happened to me (being able to sign up for classes via telebears, but then never getting a bill).  And then there was that two semesters of not being official registered-drama... be really careful, it's a huge pain retroactively adding everything.</p>

1. my registration block was cleared. in bearfacts, it says "released."
2. i can sign up for classes via telebears just fine.
3. but bearfacts also says student has no fees due this term and no statement was sent asking for money.

= strange. slightly worrisome. too late in the day, perhaps, to do anything about it now; will call tomorrow morning i suppose.
