      <p>I'm not planning on being up North anytime soon, but perhaps later in the year I could be pursuaded to head up for a weekend or something.  Would love to see you.</p>

      <p>channing at college. between a sorority house and a fraternity house. </p>
      <p>this morning i heard the girls chanting something about how they are better than all the other girls. and all night there are drunken girls screaming. </p>
      <p>but who cares? i'm a really heavy sleeper. derek (my new roommate) says we're lucky we're not on the side bordering the frat.</p>
