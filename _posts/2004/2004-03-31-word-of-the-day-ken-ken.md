      <p>lol, when i read the first 2 lines of your post, i immediately thought, "wow, i think the only time i've really ever heard that word used is in that song that Liesl sings in 'The Sound of Music'" Actually, "ken" means "Prefecture" in Japanese (like States in the US), so I've heard people say "it's beyond my ken" (as in, i had to go to a different prefecture) before, as a silly kind of joke. not really funny, but, yeah.</p>

oh my god! now "i am sixteen going on seventeen" makes sense! you know,
totally unprepared am I 
to face a world of men 
timid and shy and scared am I 
of things beyond my **ken**
I need someone older and wiser
telling me what to do...
