      <p>FYI, the word <i>meme</i> was coined by <a href="http://www.world-of-dawkins.com/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">Richard Dawkins</a> in his book, <i>The Selfish Gene</i>.</p>
      <p><i>Examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches.  Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperms or eggs, so memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via a process which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation.  If a scientist hears, or reads about, a good idea, he passed it on to his colleagues and students.  He mentions it in his articles and his lectures.  If the idea catches on, it can be said to propagate itself, spreading from brain to brain.  As my colleague N.K. Humphrey neatly summed up an earlier draft of this chapter: `... memes should be regarded as living structures, not just metaphorically but technically.(3)  When you plant a fertile meme in my mind you literally parasitize my brain, turning it into a vehicle for the meme's propagation in just the way that a virus may parasitize the genetic mechanism of a host cell.  And this isn't just a way of talking -- the meme for, say, "belief in life after death" is actually realized physically, millions of times over, as a structure in the nervous systems of individual men the world over.'</i></p>

      <p>Memes also feature heavily in the book <i>Snow Crash</i> by Neal Stephenson.</p>
      <p>That's how I learned of 'em.</p>

I can't believe I used the word "meme."

Elton John - Your Song
Andrew Lloyd Weber - All I Ask of You (from Phantom)
Prince of Egypt - Michelle Pfeiffer & Sally Dworski - When You Believe
DeCadence - the DeCadence Throughout the Decades concert (Spring 2001) - Summertime/Motherless Child
Musical Youth - Pass the Dutchie
Nine Inch Nails - Closer
DeCadence - A Zebra Heard (cd 2003) - Life, In A Nutshell
Beck - Guess I'm Doing Fine
Belle and Sebastian - Paper Boat
Women's Choir (coastal honor choir 2001 I think, when my brother was in the mixed honor choir) - Away From the Roll of the Sea

That's a lot of decadence stuff. Huh. I told Ryan that if you look at my media you get kind of a weird mix. I mean, "Backstreet Boys - More Than That" coming on after "Pharoahe Monch - Fuck You" coming on after "Avalon - Testify to Love" coming on after "sexy underwear" coming on after "every story is a love story from aida the disney musical" is kinda weird. I have a bunch of weird reggae shit because of Olivia and a bunch of hip hop because of Joan and etc

I went to a bunch of graduations. Good job and congratulations to the people I graduated from high school with four years ago. It's a little tough seeing you be done, but that WILL be me someday too (thanks for being supportive).
