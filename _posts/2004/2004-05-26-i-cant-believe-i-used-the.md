That's a lot of decadence stuff. Huh. I told Ryan that if you look at my media you get kind of a weird mix. I mean, "Backstreet Boys - More Than That" coming on after "Pharoahe Monch - Fuck You" coming on after "Avalon - Testify to Love" coming on after "sexy underwear" coming on after "every story is a love story from aida the disney musical" is kinda weird. I have a bunch of weird reggae shit because of Olivia and a bunch of hip hop because of Joan and etc

I went to a bunch of graduations. Good job and congratulations to the people I graduated from high school with four years ago. It's a little tough seeing you be done, but that WILL be me someday too (thanks for being supportive).
