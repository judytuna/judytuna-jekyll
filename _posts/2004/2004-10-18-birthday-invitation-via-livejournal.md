      <p>2 B-days in one night?</p>
      <p>I'm going to another Acapella-related B-Day party tonight, but it's scheduled earlier (6:30/7:30). Unfortunately, it's down Gilman, past San Pablo, so getting back in time for your dinner might be tricky.<br />
      I'd like to swing by your apartment and wish you well in person, but I don't know where it is!<br />
      If you get a chance, give me a call at 925 914 1747 and let me know how to find your place! </p>
      <p><i>Happy Birthday!</i></p>

Hey guys. My birthday's Friday the 22nd (and I'm turning 22! Woohoo,  it'll only happen once in my life!!!), and I'd like to host a  party-thing on the evening of Saturday the 23rd. 
 
1. Dinner at 8pm at Shen Hua (on College Avenue in Berkeley...  [<http://www.elmwoodshop.com/pages/stores/shenhua.html>](http://www.elmwoodshop.com/pages/stores/shenhua.html)) 
 
2. Party-thing at my apartment after dinner (9 or 9:30). We can like,  play games and hang out and dance around and stuff. 
 
Tell me if you'd like to come to either or both or anything. Shen Hua is  a yummy Chinese restaurant, one away from La Med.
