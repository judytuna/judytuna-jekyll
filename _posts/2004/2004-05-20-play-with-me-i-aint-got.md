      <p>Joseph Campbell taught at SLC.  I've seen the PBS <i>Power of Myth</i> series like a zillion times.  He was kind of an ass, so the story goes.</p>

Play with me. I ain't got shit to do.

That's a lie, I've got plenty of shit to do, like sign up for a class, figure out how to get a job next semester, learn about China, read *The Power Of Myth* by Joseph Campbell. But play with me anyway.
