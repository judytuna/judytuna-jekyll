New Gadget Prevents Laptop-Induced Infertility in Men; X-Files Actor 
Invents Patented Solution

LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)----As the X-Files science fiction TV character 
Langly, actor Dean Haglund is the familiar face of everyone's favorite 
techno-geek. In a case where fact isn't far removed from fiction, Haglund 
is also the face behind his own techno-geek invention, the "Chill Pak." 
Haglund recently patented the Chill Pak, a cooling system for computer 
laptops, which were identified in a study last week as the culprits behind 
lowering sperm counts in men.

    Haglund's Chill Pak is a freezable mat designed for placement beneath a 
laptop to cool the CPU (Central Processing Unit), which tends to overheat 
when users run today's computer programs. Not only does this cooling action 
allow the laptop to run faster and more smoothly, it also prevents the 
overheating attributed to male infertility. The Chill Pak is encased in a 
condensation-free material to protect the electronics from moisture.

    Haglund inadvertently discovered this innovation while recovering from 
a knee injury. Haglund recalls, "I was watching a movie on my laptop, and 
it kept locking up on me. The ice pack protecting my knee injury 
accidentally slid underneath my laptop, and the movie immediately began 
playing, trouble-free. I realized the cooling action of the ice pack was 
the key." Haglund immediately launched his Chill Pak invention through his 
own company Geek Chic, which is scheduled for beta-testing with Time Warner 
Cable employees nationwide. The Chill Pak retails for an affordable $19.95 
and can be personalized with corporate logos.

    A stand-up comedian as well as an actor, Haglund's quick humor is found 
in Chill Pak's slogan: "A laptop without a Chill Pak is like a techno-geek 
without corrective shoes...it runs, but not as fast." Haglund currently has 
two additional computer products in development under his own Geek Chic label.
