Being volatile and timid is a bad thing. If you were volatile and bold, your life might be fucked up, but at least you'd be interesting, and you wouldn't care if people didn't like you. You'd be successful and influential when you were in an upswing, even if you lashed at people in your downswing. If you were steady at all, you would be level-headed and responsible. And you'd be respected for being level-headed and responsible. If you are volatile and timid, like me, then your life is fucked up, you care if people don't like you, you're irresponsible, you're too much of a wuss to try to exert your influence over others, you complain to yourself that you're a follower and not a leader, and you're constantly saying things like "it's bad to be volatile and timid."
