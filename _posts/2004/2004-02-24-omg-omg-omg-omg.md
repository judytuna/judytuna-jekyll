      <p>Whereas I only watched my first complete X-Files episode ever just last night.  (I'd watched bits of episodes before, and even a couple almost all the way through.)</p>

      <p>OMG!!!!!!</p>
      <p>Which one?!?!?!</p>
      <p>In Nabokov, the prof went off on a tangent on wanting to compile a list on a webpage of all the movies that have that gimmick where two people are talking on the phone and there's a split screen. The girl next to me said "Bye Bye Birdie" and he said "thanks!" and wrote it down. I said "They spoof that in an X-files episode." He said, "That'll probably be harder to find." I would have said "Actually, the episode is called Hollywood AD" but I think people already thought I was scary, so I didn't. But one of these days I'm going to get a hold of the clip and go to his office hours with it. OMG it's the funniest thing ever. They're all taking bubble baths and lying about it. Wahaha.</p>

      <p>That's hilarious.</p>
      <p><i>Which one?!?!?!</i></p>
      <p>I don't know the episode title, but it's the one where Mulder gets transported back to a cruise ship during WWII.   showed it to me because a couple of weeks ago "Angel" had a WWII episode, and from the teasers the previous week she thought it was going to be a complete X-Files ripoff. It wasn't, of course, but since she'd mentioned it, I then had to see it.  And it was very good, indeed.</p>

      <p>OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG! YOU SAW TRIANGLE! THAT'S THE BEST EVER! (well along with a bunch of other ones)</p>
      <p>OMG I LOVE THAT ONE!</p>
      <p>I can play that love theme at the end on the piano.</p>
      <p>They filmed it with realtime superlong shots, 4 minutes each, so it was really hard. OMG!</p>

      <p><i>They filmed it with realtime superlong shots, 4 minutes each,</i></p>
      <p>Apparently it was a tribute to a Hitchcock film. But now I've forgotten which one.  Basically, since they never cut, they just use the film until it runs out; if they need to change it, they pan to a dark spot (like a shadowed wall) so that the change isn't noticed.</p>
      <p>This is the sort of trivia I get for watching things with , who a) knows lots about film and b) is a major X-Phile.</p>
