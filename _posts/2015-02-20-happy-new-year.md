A few weeks ago, we went to Trick Dog and saw their new menu: a fantastic rendition of a Chinese restaurant. Since today is Chinese New Year, and we were feeling chill (I’ll see my parents this weekend), we hopped along to check out the scene at Trick Dog. As we were crossing the street, I said to Kimon, “there had better be lion dancers!” and found that he hadn’t seen lion dancers before! I promised him I’d show him some youtube videos later. We feared it would be packed with people celebrating, but it was a normal Thursday night, and we were able to get a table right away. Right after our drinks got to us, we heard cheers downstairs… and I noticed that there was a drum song on that was unmistakably lion dancey… so we ran to the banister and sure enough, a lion came jumping through.

I love this city.
