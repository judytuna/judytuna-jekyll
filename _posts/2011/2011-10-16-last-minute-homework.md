I’m taking [ai-class.com](http://ai-class.com) with 130,000 people on the internet. [80,000 were active](https://twitter.com/#!/aiclass/status/125309361449996288) in a 24-hour period over the weekend. Homework 1 is due in about 4 hours (4:59pm on Sunday Oct. 16 in my time zone), so naturally, I’m doing the homework now. 

Here I am, chugging along through the videos, when they stop loading. I reload the page and get this: “We’ve had an absolutely massive surge of last-minute homework submissions.

We’re going to be back online soon. The deadline has been pushed back by 24 hours to 23:59 UTC on the 17th.”
