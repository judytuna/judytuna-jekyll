It's easier to [microblog](http://status.judytuna.com) than to post here. Here, I have to talk in complete sentences, and my strings of words have to make sense. In microblogging, I can just throw my chaff to the wind and watch it sparkle in the wind on the fading sunlight. 

I don't know how I feel about Egypt. How can we exist with our mundane little lives when people are marching across a bridge and embracing their military on the streets? 

I am still in the process of moving. I've got boxes and boxes of spices saved up over the years, that have come with me through several moves, and I am loath to throw any of them away, but I never cook. And I never cook because I [believe that I can't](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness). They're so full of potential, though, asking me to put them in some delicious food, waiting patiently for the day I realize that I can do whatever I want. 

I just hosted my third GSL finals viewing party at Eudemonia. Barely fewer came to this one (~65ish people) than my last one (~72 people), but this one was MORE AWESOME, for the following reasons:

	- Dean got a second projector.

	- I contacted chromate, the organizer of the epic Toronto theater finals shows, and arranged for the best of my local players to play some showmatches against the best of his local players. I threw together a last-minute small tournament and got local celebs dOpa and HD to play against slayersBekho and combatex. dOpa 2-0ed bekho, and HD 2-1ed combatex after getting some outrageous troll BM out of combatex, which is, after all, what he's known for. 

	- The OSL finals happened to be the same night. OSL is one of the two biggest Brood War tournament series. Beloved BW commentator [moletrap](http://www.youtube.com/moletrap) rolled in and commented over an OSL stream live for us!! He gets SUPER DUPER excited when he commentates live, so it was SO epic to watch and listen to. Also none of us were expecting an all-kill O.o. We had some technical difficulties at first, but we were able to broadcast his re-stream of the OSL re-stream with his english commentary (and it is automatically [recorded](http://www.justin.tv/moletrap/b/278492358) as well!), and when I peered at the #s towards the end, he had 707 people tuned in to his stream. =)

	- [VTArlock](http://justin.tv/vtarlock) organized an inhouse tournament after the OSL ended... and he went on to win it =) 

	- I ordered WAY more pizza this time, and the dude I ordered from at [West Coast](http://www.westcoastpizza.com) hooked me up with some [deals](http://berkeleygoodlife.com/coupons) (10 pies for $99 plus 3 pies for $30 HELLZ YEAH) and each person was allowed to have 4 slices. It ended up being a near-perfect amount of pizza (which isn't a good thing, because I'd rather not be so close to running out of pizza before everybody gets to it!). Still it was better than last time.

It was a great event, and I'm TOTALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING MORE. WAYYY MORE. And tournaments. And all-night lan parties. AUAUUGHGHGHHG

Also, things are really starting to move on the 25mts front. We may be embarking upon an experimental side project involving videos, and getting better sound equipment. !!! We want to organize epic League of Legends events on the scale of my GSL viewing parties, too. =D

I now live in a house of electrical engineers. The first project I'm really jazzed about will be an [8x8x8 LED cube](http://www.instructables.com/id/Led-Cube-8x8x8/). Since I am not realistic, and my random number generator is seeded with a unicorn, I will also magically learn how to use all these open libraries for Kinect hacking and I will set up the LED cube as a 3d display for the Kinect. You'll be able to see yourself represented in the cube. AWWW YEAH DREAM BIG. And we already have all kinds of plans... from shooting guns, to riding horses, to RC airplanes, to BBQs in our nice backyard (seriously it's amazing) (so is our kitchen)... We have an engineering space set up in the garage and everything. It's going to be epic living here. 

Last night, I watched my first-ever episode of Xena. I loved it.
