      That Berkeley article cites the exact research from Carol Dweck I thought of when I read the original article.

Amy Chua's WSJ article made everyone hate her. The topic has exploded all over my Facebook and elsewhere, since I am also an ABC. Here is a list of retorts and comments from all over Teh Intarwebz.

	- Original [WSJ article](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754.html)

	- lore.interi.org [discussion ](http://lore.interi.org/forum/topic/parenting-america-chinese-vs-western)by us

	- quora.com [comments](http://www.quora.com/Parenting/Is-Amy-Chua-right-when-she-explains-Why-Chinese-Mothers-Are-Superior-in-an-op-ed-in-the-Wall-Street-Journal), including one by Christine Lu about her sister who committed suicide, AND Amy Chua's response (thanks to Court)

	- A blogger's response: "[Parents like Amy Chua are the reason Asian-Americans like me are in therapy](http://bettymingliu.com/2011/01/parents-like-amy-chua-are-the-reason-why-asian-americans-like-me-are-in-therapy/)". This blog post  is especially relevant to me because of this quote: "Screwing up academically was the only power I had over my dad, a tyrant who wouldnâ€™t let me take art or English courses." (thanks to Dylan)
 
	- A Tony Hsieh [interview ](http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-tony-hsieh-zappos-2010-10)on BusinessWeek. People laud him for being "different", taking risks, and rebelling against his stereotypical asian parents.

	- And Tony Hsieh's 2010 book, [Delivering Happiness](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0446563048/?tag=bettymingliuc-20)

	- Yet another blog [response](http://www.redtri.com/are-chinese-moms-superior)

	- WSJ [published a response by Amy Chua](http://blogs.wsj.com/ideas-market/2011/01/13/the-tiger-mother-responds-to-readers/) after everybody exploded on her with banelings

	- This [SFGate article is actually positive about the book](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/01/13/apop011311.DTL), and says that the initial WSJ article was trolling for publicity. Apparently the book's message is NOT "tiger moms are awesome" -- the message is "I tried this, it didn't work, I changed and now I have a great relationship with my daughters." (thanks to Maria)

	- [How to raise an unhappy child](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/raising_happiness/post/how_to_raise_an_unhappy_child/) from some Berkeley-related research thing or something

	- [Funny animation](http://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2011/01/chinese-mom-smash/69347/) (thanks to Tomasso)

	- [Battle-hymn of the sexually-sane mother](http://susiebright.blogs.com/susie_brights_journal_/2011/01/the-battle-hymn-of-the-sex-positive-mother.html) (thanks to [maiki](http://interi.org))

I get insane and upset thinking about this whole thing, so I'll leave it at this list for now.

Thank you everyone for discussing it with me. It's good to get it out of my system. Even though I'm torturing myself, please, please talk to me about it more. It'll only help.
