Todo:

Trine via the Humble Indie Bundle 3, because there’s been some buzz about it.
Shadowgrounds, via the above.
Spiral Knights via maiki via penny arcade.
Puzzle Pirates via Kyle and others, because they kept telling me how it was awesome years ago and I just never played it, and now I’m interested again because they’re who makes Spiral Knights.
Borderlands muliplayer with Fritz, because it was on sale today for $7.50.
Magicka, because the Vietnam DLC just came out–I haven’t bought it because I haven’t finishes Magicka yet.
Portal 2 comes out in only six days.

[A House of Champions](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=206364), because a teamliquid.net forum member made it.
I have to play my placement match for season 2 of Starcraft II. I’ve been delaying it due to fear that I’ll get placed back into Silver (I was promoted to Gold more than a month ago, but then the season ended). I have to work harder. Learn a 4gate and go to diamond.
Learn to play Janna in League of Legends. Play more. Get to 30. Grind out some runes. Buy the lion dance kog’maw skin, because I have to, because I am Chinese. Damn I have a lot of catching up to do.
Tend farm in Haven and Hearth. Go on a hunting expedition with Kevin and Joe. Make silk! Maybe get a village claim with them so we can teleport to Cocksville. Find minerals. Find Lost Temple.
Get on xbox live with kim and andy and finish ilo milo haha
Do more research on 3ds games…
Left4Dead2 [Helm’s Deep](http://www.l4dmaps.com/details.php?file=7302) mod, because Jon really loves it.

And this doesn’t even list the stuff from the last humble indie bundle, or the steam potato sack which I just bought. AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
