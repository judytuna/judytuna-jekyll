I came to [Noisebridge](http://noisebridge.net) for the Tuesday night [Ruby class](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Ruby_class) and stayed for the [MakerBots](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Makerbot). 

I printed a [tiny open-source violin](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3193), and then a [hairclip with stars](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9948) that was popular on thingiverse. It was sort of hard to get it to work â€” the machine with the red material has some trouble maintaining a constant extrusion flow. So it came out rather less than perfect. Here is a picture of me wearing it anyway.
