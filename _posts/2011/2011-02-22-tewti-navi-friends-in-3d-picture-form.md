You can’t tell from my 2d picture, but this is a piece of cardboard with plastic over the picture, and the people pop out as if it were a 3d picture! I think that they traced each person and assigned them a depth in a simulated 3d space (cuz I don’t think this was taken with a 3d camera). It’s like the 3d photos of Grace and Neytiri and Neytiri’s sister on the fridge at the iknimaya station!!!

It JUST came in the mail today from [Xelloss](http://forum.learnnavi.org/profile/?u=939), all the way from France. He’s the one with the bracers next to me in the pic–he came here to california last year just for the Learn Na’vi workshop weekend with [Karyu Pawl](http://naviteri.org), hosted by [Prrton](http://masempul.org/blog/). Here’s the company/technology used to create the 3d picture: http://www.limbricateur.com/Un_peu_de_theorie.html

The [Learn Na’vi](http://forum.learnnavi.org) community is truly amazing!
