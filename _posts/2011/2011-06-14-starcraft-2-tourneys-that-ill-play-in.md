I am going to participate in a couple of online starcraft cups! 

1) [r/starcraft](http://reddit.com/r/starcraft)'s open clan, [r/almostrelevant](http://reddit.com/r/almostrelevant), is hosting an internal league. I signed up for the gold division. Group play leading to brackets. They JUST put up the first matches! We're responsible for finding our partner, scheduling/playing games, then uploading replays/results and awaiting our next matchup. Current status here:

2) The [Ironlady](http://www.nationalesl.com/us/sc2/ironlady/) cup! National ESL's women's league! I signed up for it! I'm not gonna get very far, but I'm participating in it just to show support or something. I'll also submit an application to help admin the cup! Despite ubiquitous [negative comments](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=228711) and rumblings of "[but it's really hard to be a man too](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/)", I like a female cup. I like to see more girls playing.

And despite how exhausting it is to think about the community's negative reactions to the idea of a women's cup, there are a few positive responses in there, and whatever -- we'll have fun. So there's that.
