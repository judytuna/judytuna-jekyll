Korean article on women in esports, translated by a member of the TL community: http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=181644

I haven't even read half the article yet, but:

> Lee So-Ra: Have you ever thought 'I wish I was born a man'?

Jung So-Lim: I wish that I would be born a man in my next life every time I wake up in the morning. Be it an e-sports career or not, Korea's social system makes me want to live as a man.
