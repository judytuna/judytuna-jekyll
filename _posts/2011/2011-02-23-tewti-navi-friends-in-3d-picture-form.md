You can't tell from my 2d picture, but this is a piece of cardboard with plastic over the picture, and the people pop out as if it were a 3d picture! I think that they traced each person and assigned them a depth in a simulated 3d space (cuz I don't think this was taken with a 3d camera). It's like the 3d photos of Grace and Neytiri and Neytiri's sister on the fridge at the iknimaya station!!!

It JUST came in the mail today from [Xelloss](http://forum.learnnavi.org/profile/?u=939), all the way from France. He's the one with the bracers next to me in the pic--he came here to california last year just for the Learn Na'vi workshop weekend with [Karyu Pawl](http://naviteri.org), hosted by [Prrton](http://masempul.org/blog/). Here's the company/technology used to create the 3d picture: http://www.limbricateur.com/Un_peu_de_theorie.html

The [Learn Na'vi](http://forum.learnnavi.org) community is truly amazing!
