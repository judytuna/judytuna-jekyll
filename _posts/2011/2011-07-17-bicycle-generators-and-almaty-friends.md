Today I was looking at my google+ stream, and I saw a post that my friend [Morgan](https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Flanguid.carbonmade.com%2F&h=-AQCLCB8E) was, well, Hanging Out. I hadn’t used the Hangouts feature of google+ before and I’d kept hearing about [how awesome it was](http://gigaom.com/video/google-hangouts-technology/), so I clicked the friendly “join” button. I found myself staring at the faces of Morgan (who is in [San Francisco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco)) and his friend Asya (who is [far far away](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almaty)). After Morgan went back to work, Asya and I chatted for like an hour.

She has an idea to use bicycle generators to power a projector for free screenings of movies in public parks. I think this is a genius idea and am shocked and appalled that this isn’t already happening at Dolores Park every week or something. Therefore I put forth a motion to make Almaty-SF sister bicycle generator projects. Hahahaha. Maybe later we can group chat with them using bicycle-powered laptops or something (the time difference would be kinda weird but you know, whatever). To that end, we’ve looked at an [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Bicyle-Power-for-Your-Television%2c-Laptop%2c-or-Cell-/), a [website](http://www.los-gatos.ca.us/davidbu/pedgen.html), and some [articles](http://boingboing.net/2009/04/20/pedal-powered-electr.html) about people who made the instructables and websites… haha.

She says she was inspired by [the timeless way of building](http://www.amazon.com/Timeless-Way-Building-Christopher-Alexander/dp/0195024028) by [Christopher Alexander](http://www.patternlanguage.com/). She would love to see a world where we make stuff in our own communities. “Maybe it will be a whole movement, like slow cooking.” I hope so.

She showed me the [Dombura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dombura) in her room after I asked about it, because I could see it on a dresser in the background. We talked about how we are both night owls. We talked about other projects too. She told me about [these berkeley guys](https://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2011/07/08/berkeley-grads-break-into-green-business-shrooms-in-a-box) that took coffee grinds from the waste stream and grew mushrooms, and her oakland friend who organized [a surplus fruit exchange](http://forageoakland.blogspot.com/) complete with jam-making parties. 

I really get a kick out of this. Today, I learned about self-sustainability and the reduction/re-purposing of waste in an increasingly globalized world, but from someone really really far away, because we have the internet and the exchange of ideas is free.
