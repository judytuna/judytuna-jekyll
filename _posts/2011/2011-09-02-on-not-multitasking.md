      I do the same thing, though not to the extent that you do. That is why I pointed it out!
      
      <a>Susan</a>, on the other hand, can stay super-focused. I blame video games. I also use video games as a way to show how I am better than Susan at something.
      
      So there! ^_^

Last Tuesday, at the Starmonkeys Ruby class, another student said that she'd audited a Software as a Service course at Berkeley. 

So I looked it up and found the [RAD lab](http://radlab.cs.berkeley.edu/wiki/RAD_Lab) and got a [class syllabus for cs169 from fall 2010](https://docs.google.com/View?id=dj8rzs7_665crqd4kcg) and started reading it. There's a big prominent link at the top of that syllabus that says "Why I advise you not to multitask in lecture." So naturally I clicked on that and got to [this research study on how multitasking is terrible](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/august24/multitask-research-study-082409.html). 

Then I felt really embarrassed. haha!

I didn't really think about "multitasking" being a part of how I "work" until [maiki](http://interi.org) mentioned it once. He said that I was manic! And I do always have 100 tabs open in Firefox and tons of unfinished projects. 

So I must learn to focus. Not just to finish my projects, but to also not be rude at classes and stuff.
