things that i mean to write about:
pierre (fr peter's priest friend from rome) coming to visit us
war and peace newman sunday night w/ fr dick
LA congress
maybe later. for now: congress was good. the speakers were engaging and entertaining and had many good points. i think i was hit hardest by fr osborne's talks on the catholic sacraments in a postmodern world: we are treading in minefields here. God's grace = all around already, it is not enough if you say "if you do this sacrament, you will be "saved""-->then what is the point of the sacraments... externalization of love? this also ties into that lovely age-old question of grace vs good works... 

i want to major in philosophy. or physics. or... 

naning's off to a midterm. good luck naning. =)
