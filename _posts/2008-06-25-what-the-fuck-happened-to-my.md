what the fuck happened to my voice? nothing about it feels right. it's like pushing air through sandpaper with molasses on it. maybe i talked a lot tonight or something. i'm trying to sing along to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrjQmZ8t8nQ and i can't do it at all. there's some kind of weird falsetto thing going on with my voice where i can't control it and it flops all over the place. totally unpredictable. it's freaking me out.
