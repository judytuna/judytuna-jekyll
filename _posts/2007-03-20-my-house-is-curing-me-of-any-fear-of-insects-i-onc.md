i woke up with a spider on my face today. i felt an itch and rubbed my face on my pillow and drew back to look and there was a tiny tiny little brown spider stunned on my pillow and i snatched it up between my thumbnail and forefinger without even thinking and leapt up to wash it off. i felt no horror, no revulsion, but i did mop the bathroom and the kitchen and will start on my room after a short break. this is what happens with old houses, i guess. there are always spiders around my desk, too, hanging out on my computer speakers, or crawling along my wall. tiny little brown ones.
