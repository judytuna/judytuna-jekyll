[directdk](http://directdk.livejournal.com/) and [ill_reflectz](http://ill_reflectz.livejournal.com/) had a show in Texas last week. They performed four songs. I just saw the videos and oh my goodness they're amazing. And on youtube! http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=directdk

They added a "raise your hands" thing to the Vienna song and get mobbed in "Drift Away" and T is getting really good at interfacing with the crowd. As some friend of Derek's said, I've never seen so many asian people so excited.

In other apt 105 news, the lead singer of L'arc~en~ciel is FUCKING HOT. I would become lesbian for him, man though he is
