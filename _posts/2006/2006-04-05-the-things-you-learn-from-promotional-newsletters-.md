      <p>I love that! Especially the CSN reference. And also that they didn't include Neil Young (CSNY). </p>

      <p>On August 9th 2010, depending on how precise your timepiece is, it'll be: 12:34:56.7 8/9/10</p>
      <p>I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to <i>that</i> one.</p>

      <p>So, the limiting factor is the hours and months?</p>
      <p>In that case, the best we can do is </p>
      <p>12:34:567891011 12/13/14</p>
      <p>So... after 2014 we'll have to change calendars or something?</p>
      <p>Anyway, we'll never have it as good as we did shortly after<br />
