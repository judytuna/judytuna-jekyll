11:24am: http://quake.usgs.gov/recenteqs/Quakes/nc40183687.htm -- I felt it, but I thought it was a truck passing by. The second quake (stronger and 10 minutes later) prompted me to check the website.

It was very short, but packed a strong jolt--you could really feel the Z-axis on this one. I looked up an Jenny's flying pig was definitely swinging above my desk.

I wonder if there will be any more today.

Edit: there was one more. 10:08pm: http://quake.usgs.gov/recenteqs/Quakes/nc40183696.htm
My roommates were around to feel this one, too.
