The Lunar festival has begun in WoW. There's a party in Moonglade (and a raid boss), fireworks that you have to use launchers to shoot, "festival dumplings," firecrackers hanging from the eaves of buildings, beer that makes you glow. There are Elders all over the world, bathed in a silver stream of light, and you go "honor" them by talking to them, and they give you a coin that you can trade in for stuff--engineering schematics to make firework launchers, tailoring patterns for red chi pao and pantsuit, or already-made chi pao/suits of other colors. It makes me so happy. I mean come on. CHI PAOS! Pom got a purple one. It doesn't get any better than this. Help me, this is beyond addiction. Does Animal Crossing celebrate the lunar new year too?
