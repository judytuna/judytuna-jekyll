      <p>Instead of getting up when you wake up, you could try forcing yourself to lie in bed for a normal time period. Then get up. Eventually, you'll start being tired at the right time.</p>

      <p>Are you on cold medication?  Nyquil does not make me sleepy.  Also sleep is often strongly tied in with emotion.  This is actually Elanor.  I am too lazy to sign out of Lisa's account.</p>
