      <p>Nothing. I don't own any makeup that didn't come as part of a free Estee Lauder gift pack from when my aunts shop at Macy's, but Ryan just sent me "fluidline eye-liner gel" http://www.maccosmetics.com/templates/products/sp.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY15101&amp;PRODUCT_ID=PROD7715 in "macroviolet." Also, a funny little brush with an angled tip. I have no idea how to use it. And no idea where to look????????? Do you know any, uh, "here is how to put on makeup and not look like a drunk raccoon" websites? I suck at this girl thing WOE</p>

      <p>it's like painting!  You probably want to close the eye that you're putting on the liner, so that you can get the part closest to your lashes. I don't like putting eyeliner on the bottom lid (except on halloween) mainly cuz my eyelashes smudge everything down there, but people basically put it at the bottom lash line.</p>

      <p>I like analogies</p>
      <p>I imagine it's like when you're painting a room--first you have to lay down a coat of primer.</p>
