An apartment upstairs has a drum kit and an electric guitar and they're playing Muse. I recognized a guitar riff yesterday, and just now I heard "supermassive black hole" and "map of the problematique." I need to find out which apartment they live in so I can express my undying adulation. And sing with them.
