      <p>Aww poor Judy. We used too many of your quarters when you were here. :-)</p>

      <p>Re: .</p>
      <p>Alas, the true and boring explanation is that I used some of her quarters to do laundry.</p>

      <p>I can't tell if you're being sarcastic, but...</p>
      <p>Yep, just ask for $10 in quarters. You might have to buy something, but even if you don't need groceries, it's always nice to have some altoids handy.</p>

      <p>I wasn't being sarcastic, haha. I just assumed that they'd say no if you asked for change in quarters or something--I'd never tried, but I guess it is sufficient to say that I live in constant fear of immutable oft-imaginary laws that govern human interactions.</p>
      <p>My mom included a box of Altoids and a box of Lime Mint tic tacs ("both on sale at Walgreen's, that's why I bought them, here, take them") in her giant package of apples and asian pears and chocolate silk soymilk individual-serving packs and bottle of juice squeezes. Lime Mint tic tacs are disgusting. I like orange tic tacs (and of course regular white ones are still the best in my opinion) but these green ones are just awful.</p>

      <p>Don't let my imagination run wild..</p>
      <p>I guessed the worst they could do was say "no" when I asked them, but I guess that's not <i>really</i> the worst they could do. The worst I imagine they could do involves some of the equipment in the deli section...</p>
      <p>They have <i>spearmint</i> altoids now, that don't quite have the sinus clearing power of regular peppermint altoids. They're less of an adventure, but easier to enjoy. I've never been a huge fan of tictacs in general--there's not enough flavor there.</p>

I put on my jacket to go outside to get quarters for laundry but it's 6:05pm and all the banks are closed. No clean clothes for Judy!
