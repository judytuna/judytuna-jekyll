      <p>OKAY! i'll find you on aim sometime.............</p>
      <p>we can connect to a public server like tetrinet.org and join a game together; that way we won't have to worry about routers and exchanging ip addresses and not being able to host because of routers and whatnot</p>
      <p>if you download blocktrix, it's exactly the same interface, but it allows the tetrinet.org to keep track of wins and losses =) but we can still play using the oldschool .exe</p>
