1. the girls across the way sing along to "all i want for christmas is you" every day at around this time. they've kept it up for like a week.
1.5. oh, it's a mariah carey cd. for some reason the only song i've caught in the last week was the christmas one, but they're on hero now. o mariah. also, they do "california," but probably because of the OC /scoff. i liked phantom planet. i wish i hadn't lost all those mp3s.
1.5...5?. nm they're on hanson now.
1.5.5.5. they're on "respect" now, but the guys above just put on "tearing up my heart" to compete. both parties are singing at the tops of their lungs. hmm what shall i add to the fray? oh, nothing, since i can't be bothered to install sound drivers! ha ha ha! i think i'm just gonna sing along until someone notices me TEARIN UP MY HEART AND SOUL, WE'RE APART I FEEL IT TOOOO, AND NO MATTER WHAAT I DOOO I FEEEEL THE PAAIAAAIN, WITH OR WIIITHOUT YOUUU ahh that felt good.
1.5.5.5.5. speaking of the guys above, last week there was a fight. "get the fuck out of my room" was bellowed a few times and there was much stomping. we happened to see one of them in the elevator the next evening and d asked what they were fighting about. guy's answer: "well, we discovered that someone throws the toilet paper away in the trash can instead of flushing it. and we were like, 'who doesn't flush their toilet paper?? that's disgusting!' so we had a whole controversy over it." the latest bellowing we've had the privelege to be the audience of was "it's just a fucking facebook comment! i didn't say anything bad! she didn't say anything bad! you're making it sound like i fucking cheated with her!" for an hour. we think they should just break up. their make-up sex must be really good.
1.5.5.5.5.5. i need to use a different bullet scheme

2. onset of a rather severe case of suspenders-fetish. i mean, [braces](http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=936870). especially redundant ones.
god, they're so hot.
ah, message boards, where other people understand my obsession. fan the flames.
2...1?. they really type "innit." they also call each other things like "twat," "pillock" and "wanker," and they tend to be more fond of "cunt" than i think we americans are. also, "mates," "bless," etc
