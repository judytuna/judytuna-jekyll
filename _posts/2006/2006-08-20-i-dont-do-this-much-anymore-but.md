      <p>We were actually unsuccessful in seeing "Lady in the Water" becasue when we got to the window, the lady said, oh, i don't think we're showing that anymore, even though i checked Fandango 3 hrs previous, and what would happen if i ordered tickets online? Anyway, we saw "Talladega Nights" instead, despite my non-enthusiasm, but it was really funny, and I enjoyed it.</p>
