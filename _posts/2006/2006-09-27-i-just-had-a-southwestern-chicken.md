I just had a southwestern chicken dinner and a movie musical with the smores. The dinner was very yummy; there were beans, stuffed chicken breast, and jalapenos that were not too spicy. As for Newsies, DANCING BOYS IN SUSPENDERS. That is all I have to say. 

(It's actually not all I have to say. I just spent half an hour searching through [screencap](http://www.ktnb.net/caps/newsies/) [websites](http://www.screencapcentral.net/newsies/index2.html) and I can't find a cap from the scene at the end where christian bale is wearing suspenders hanging from his pants. All the caps are of his damn face. I just want one of his ass. Is that really so much to ask? Guess [this](http://www.screencapcentral.net/newsies/newsies208.jpg)'ll have to do.)
