      <p>Hi Judy,<br />
      1. Based solely on your near daily muse devotionals on LJ, I grabbed Black Holes and Revelations a week ago. I'm hooked. Ordered some earlier CDs today. Knights of Cydonia forever!<br />
      2. I also recently picked up Magnetic North. Really a good CD! And your track is the best one on it... nice job.</p>

      <p>NO ONE'S GONNA TAKE ME ALIIIIIIIIVE!!!!!</p>
      <p>HOORAY! HOORAY! HOORAY!</p>
      <p>HOORAY!</p>
      <p>http://www.muse.mu is the official website. You can stream everything from their proper albums there (there are four, plus Hullabaloo, the album of bsides/live tracks), plus many of the music videos (not all though). Other than that, http://www.musewiki.org is a great resource (stuff like lists of bsides). Their bsides are really, really good. I should send you some (Glorious and Easily are some of the best. I also really like In Your World). </p>
      <p>What else did you get? You can't go wrong with Absolution... I'll talk your ear off.</p>
      <p>On Magnetic North: hooray! Again! Derek and Theresa are moving to New York sometime in the next few months to really pursue their music career. Which is why I have to move out now, haha. I'm glad you like the CD =D</p>

      <p>another thing</p>
      <p>I voxed the extended Assassin that was just released on the KoC single (in Europe)--you can hear it <a href="http://judytuna.vox.com/library/audio/6a00c22529c75d604a00cd970406034cd5.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>! Why "Grand Omega Bosses edit" ? A few years ago on an American tour they started encoding their setlists with messages to their fans. They called the as-yet unnamed Assassin (which back then had the middle riff that's not on bh&amp;r) "Debase Masons Grog," an anagram of "Messageboard Song." Grand Omega Bosses is another anagram. =) They also had these bikes that they couldn't take back to England with them, so they tied them up under a bridge and then hid messages to fans in their setlists telling them where to find them. One of the people who <a href="http://invictus.softmeg.com/page.php?id=732" rel="nofollow">got one of the bikes</a> is still an active member on the message boards and stuff.</p>
      <p>They still do it--as recently as August. On muselive.com someone called "Mr. X" posted a 30-second preview clip of the bside on the Starlight single before it came out, only accessible after decoding a REALLY elaborate message. It involved, among other things, patterns, puzzles, using base64 to get a url to a flickr image that was a sudoku you had to solve to get the password to the file... http://invictus.softmeg.com/forums.php?m=posts&amp;q=16636</p>
      <p>I love this band.</p>
