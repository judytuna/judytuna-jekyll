      <p>you should have seen me when I played Animal Crossing for the GC... we collected every single piece of furniture that you could obtain from your own game without trading with people... every single bug, dinosaur bone, painting, we ate, slept, dreamt AC... hahahah... I'm both afraid and excited to start the DS version.</p>

      <p>OMG START IT! We can like, have fishing contests, and like, hang out at each others' houses...</p>
      <p>I've done lots of trading with Ryan already--selling non-native fruit is lucrative, especially when you're first starting out. So I can't say I'm your brand of hardcore. But at least I've never messed with the time or date to get more bells or non-seasonal fish/insects, though it's tempting.</p>
      <p>How the #$%^ do you catch bees??!! Ryan's managed to do it but I got stung the last 5 times I tried =( =(</p>
      <p>Did you follow the whole Feng Shui thing on your GC too? How did these people at this site figure out each piece of furniture's correct Feng Shui color??? Trial and error??!!?!</p>

      <p>Yeah, we never messed with the time or date either... although it was very very tempting on special occasions when more time was needed to get the last piece of furniture in a set (like the Spooky set~~ was 2 hours late to a Halloween party that night as a result~~lame I know).</p>
      <p>Oh, bees are kind of tough, you gotta time it just right.  Like, I usually would shake the tree, start running, then take out my net and turn and aim.  But it's really kind of a luck with timing sort of thing; I've gotten stung a lot, too.  </p>
      <p>And about the Feng Shui I think it's trial and error.  It seems like sometimes it doesn't work even though it's the right color, so I'd just mess around with it.  As for points, it seemed like the more random full sets and special items (like the Mario statue or the boat in a bottle) you had scattered throughout the house, the more points you would get... even if the house looked retarded afterwards.  So after I got to the max points so I could get the prize, I just went back and organized it to my liking.</p>
      <p>Do they have an island in the DS version with the funny turtle that hits on you while he's sailing you there?</p>
