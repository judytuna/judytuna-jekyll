      <p>Have you heard about this?</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, rank opportunism of <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7667194685876573666&amp;pl=true" rel="nofollow">this magnitude</a> strikes me as hilarious.</p>
      <p>You have to admit that having an public funeral gathering ingame on a <i>PvP</i> server does seem like a bad idea..</p>

      <p>Re: Have you heard about this?</p>
      <p>Yeah, now whenever anyone tries to hold an event (such as a pvp tournament with both factions involved, complete with a police force), everyone says "we can be the Serenity Now of the server and RUIN IT!!!"</p>
      <p>I actually think that they were assholes for doing it, and immature for crowing about it everywhere, but they love e-ttention, so whatever. I'm with the camp of people that wants everyone to have respect for the human beings behind the computer. I'm not a brutal pvper, anyway--usually if I encounter horde questing or whatever around me, I'll wave and dance and go on my merry way; I don't attack unless provoked. Usually. </p>
