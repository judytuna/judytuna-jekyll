i can't fuckin' sleep. i'm tired and my ears hurt and i have a dry dry dry rattling cough. i just wanted to report that tommy of decadence is on SMT. isn't that funny? i used to be on SMT. catholicism and newman used to be a huge part of my life. decadence moved rehearsals to mondays so that tommy could go to seekers on tuesdays. isn't that funny? i stopped going to seekers because i got into decadence. i didn't have enough self-worth to try to ask decadence to move rehearsals to mondays. that's so sad. that's so sad. i can go back to newman, you know. i don't know why i haven't.
