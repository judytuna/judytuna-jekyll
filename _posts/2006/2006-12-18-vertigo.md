I sent an email to my high school's literary magazine asking them about their website, which had disappeared. I got this in reply:

*If you haven't heard, the Vertigo class got cut...so now we're a club.  We don't have a website as of now, but we'll keep you posted if we ever get around to starting it up again.  Thanks for your interest!  It's really encouraging.  Seriously.*

Sad! Sad! So Kristin and Cindy... send them a line at vertigomagazine@gmail, and tell them to keep bearing the torch! Or something inspirational. Go!
