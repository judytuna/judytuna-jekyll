      <p>Um.. not sure how to take the muse video.  Incomprehensible!!  Also, it says the director's cut is only one shot different.... You know it's the part where he does her from behind!</p>

      <p>I've spent a lot of time on this director's website. I'd seen a surprising number of these music videos before (surprising because I don't have a TV now, and we don't get cable at home, and although we did in the Gaia building I didn't watch it very much)... but it's fun to watch them again and read through the "special features." Like "Oh, no wonder that backstreet boys video was so freakin' weird" and "oh, no wonder that U2 video was so freakin' weird" and "oh, no wonder that moby video was so freakin' weird." If you haven't, you need to watch Britney Spears' Toxic, and then read the article in "special features," and then watch Toxic again. Some people take things <i>really seriously</i>. Hahahaha. Also the "lesbian cut" isn't two asians, it's one asian and one black woman who sort of has asian-esque eyes. And the Ricky Martin one is menacing and frightening but at the same time I wouldn't mind having that many. Mariah Carey is really unbelievably hot, and so absurdly sweet. I am fascinated.</p>
