      <p>Do what I did: hold out for some crucial component deal (it was a CPU/Mobo combo for me) then buy the other components at reasonable online prices. Memory is nearly always on sale, and hard drive deals are almost weekly.</p>

I have glimpsed into the world of rebates and pricematching shenanigans. It is mind-boggling. For example, another deal that I missed: http://forums.slickdeals.net/showthread.php?sduid=0&t=264536

Because of reading expired deals like this, I feel like I can't buy anything until some deal like it crops up again.

Or I may give up and buy something like http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822148131 ; I'm really tired of not having a computer.
