what a show. that shit's fucked up. the ending to this first episode was even more fucked up than the ultracynical one i was predicting. also, at one point during the episode i had to leave the room screaming.

i'm still reading through journal entries from 2004. one is about the song "closer to you" by the wallflowers. i had forgotten that song existed. as i read the lyrics i couldn't even think of the tune or what instruments it used. and i'd lost it years ago, but i fired up itunes and now i remember and i feel breathless: i loved that song.
