paper: http://labweb.education.wisc.edu/curric675/readings/SteinkuehlerICLS2004.pdf
article summarizing it: http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/internet/09/06/online.games.sociability.reut/index.html

since /system32 got corrupted or went missing again, making it so that i had to reinstall windows (even though a few weeks ago i got new ram... and a new power supply because of those problems with my video card not getting power), i haven't bothered to install programs yet, so i don't have adobe pdf viewer, so i haven't actually looked at the paper yet. this is just to make a note for myself

i'm sick--sniffly, stuffed.
