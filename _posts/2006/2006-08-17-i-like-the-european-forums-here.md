I like the european forums. Here is how to say "giev me gold plz" in 100 languages: http://forums-en.wow-europe.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-off-topic-en&t=211968&p=1&tmp=1#post211968 (no, I don't browse the euro forums, or any warcraft forums. Someone posted this to the wow lj community har har)

After my last class today (the final is tomorrow), among the people that filed in for the class after us was someone wearing a "home is where the hearthstone is" tshirt. Here it is: http://www.jinx.com/scripts/details.asp?affid=-1&productID=507 Naturally I freaked out and the conversation went like this:
me: I had to come over and talk to you because of your shirt.
him: WARCRAFT?????
me: YEAH WHAT SERVER ARE YOU ON???
him: STORMSCALE!!! WHAT DO YOU PLAY????
we look suspiciously at each other.
me: alliance...
him: WORD!!! I PLAY A PALLY!
me: SO DO I!
him: holy pally? ...you're not a retnoob are you? (suspicious again)
me: yeah holy! 
him: 31/20 ret? that's what i am!!!!!
me: no... 25/26 prot for reck-bombing priests!
him: ohhh you're a raider aren't you? kings? ha! i'm a pvper...
me: both! but i'm a pvp healer! in pvp i don't use a 2h, i use my red dragonscale protector and an azuresong...
him: AUUGH! i want field marshal but i'm only lieutenant commander... but we have finals this week so i'm deranking!!!
me: auuughhh me too! i've barely hung onto knight-captain this summer and i totally haven't played in the last few weeks!
some other guy: you guys are talking about that warcraft thing? my cousins are so into that. you people are strange.
the rest of their class: can we start class now?

man, that was awesome.

i need a warcraft shirt so i can have people come up to me and freak out about warcraft too. it's a way of life. now i need to come up with something funny of my own; "pallies do it with protection"/"druids do it like animals" was amusing for a while way back when, but meh. (mages do it with sheep, and hunters do it with their pets, and rogues do it from behind. just, you know, fyi. but this is all old news.) i liked "[green linen shirt](http://www.jinx.com/scripts/details.asp?affid=-1&productID=570)" ... meh. i see license plates that say "i'd rather be on autofollow." that's pretty funny.
