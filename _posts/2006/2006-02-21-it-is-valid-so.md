Hello!!!
My name is Dinara. I live in Russia, in the city of Elabuga. To me 27 years. I am cheerful woman, and like to do many things as sport, camping, go to the cinema, theatre etc. In a word I like to do all what like all people. I would like to find out you better, but for the beginning I shall tell a little about itself: Studied in institute also I have good educations I work as the the children's doctor. Since the childhood I have chosen for this myself trade I very much I like my work, I have respect of people with which I I work also which fly.
I can tell about myself that with a smile I go for work, therefore that really I receive great pleasure from work with children. I love children very much and I would like to have children in the future, but for the beginning I want to find the love.:)
My director has planned to open a private clinic for russian children inUSA. I and some other children's doctors of our school had an opportunityto work in the USA. To work in the USA I has passed fast rate of studying english language. To me did all necessary documents for flightin USA, but approximately one month ago director informed me that all plans are cancelled and is never possible to be carried out. I built big plans and all has failed.
Certainly I have been very much disappointed when has learned these news. Several days ago to me there has come the invitation from US the ambassador for reception of the visa. Director informed me that I can to take advantage of this visa in my personal purposes.Also director informed that can give long holiday from work if I shall decide to fly in the USA. I long thought the visa is necessary for me whether or not. I heard about your country much and it seems to me that really the best place where it is possible to live and to enjoy a life. The USA has good economy and it does yours the country stable.I think that the USA it really best place to find the love, and to live happily up to the end of a life. I always dreamed to see what life in theUSA and it is possible even to find the love there. Now this dream seems a reality because with the visa I I have an opportunity to travel in the USA. 
I have taken advice about trip to the USA at the girlfriends and they have told that will be happy for me if I shall carry out the dream of trips to the USA. Also they informed that men from USA have all qualities of the best husband. It is valid so? 
I has decided to fly in the USA, but it is difficult for me to think of flight in your country seriously because know nobody there. Probably it silly sounds, but I has decided to engage to searchesof the man from the USA on the Internet. Now I have written to you also it would be very glad if my visa was useful for ours meetings. I would like to learn you closer. To learn it is more about your plans, dreams and values. Who knows, probably we have general plans for The future and to us it will be good together!?
If you really want to find the good woman for yourself that please write to me and perhaps in the future we could know better each other and we would have our meeting and we could build the present family and good relations.Please write to me back.
I shall look forward to hearing from you.
To have good day,
Dinara
