Angela (from my high school, not [andeja](http://andeja.livejournal.com/)) passed this on to me. Her brother's friend, who is also the brother of another Lynbrook classmate from our year, is organizing a bone marrow drive on Saturday, April 1 at Lynbrook (in the south bay). I'll be on a plane coming back from Iowa, but posting this link can't hurt.

I had no idea he had leukemia.
