Tonight I baked (or rather watched E and R bake) and then ate many cookies, and then BARTed myself into SF and got happily buzzed [here](http://www.yelp.com/biz/JXSgtlcm0hLzy_RUJbnbyA) (though it was very crowded) and sang chinese songs and stuff from jazz choir in 12th grade with Tammy very loudly at Johnny Rocket's to celebrate her birthday. She has a better memory than I do. Thanks go to S for organizing and Ph for driving me home (!!!!) so I wouldn't have to take a cab (or leave right when T got there to catch the last BART). Right now the people upstairs are knocking each other around and my ceiling is going to cave in. I'm going to take out my contacts now.
