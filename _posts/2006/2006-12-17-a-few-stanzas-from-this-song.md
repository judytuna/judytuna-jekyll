in the morning through the window shade
when the light pressed up against your shoulder blade
i could see what you were reading

oh the glory when you ran outside
with your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied
and you told me not to follow you

in the morning when you finally go
and the nurse runs in with her head hung low
and the cardinal hits the window

I wish this weren't my favorite Sufjan song because it's too damn depressing.

If I had more energy I'd inspect the rhyme scheme (lack thereof?), I have some preliminary observations, like nothing rhymes with "happens," but I don't know what it shows.

I like all three versions of Chicago on Avalanche better than the one on Illinois.
