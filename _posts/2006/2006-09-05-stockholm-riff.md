I learned from this video that they play a riff at the end of Stockholm Syndrome when they do it live: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoH7zH5O34&NR

Then I saw another video in which they go absolutely nuts. The only reason I am not using all caps and copious quantities of exclamation marks is that I cannot even convey how nuts they go. Just watch it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicWFWAhDpQ&NR

I cannot stop watching live performances on youtube. On my last youtube binge I saw one for a studio audience where he goes "let hope burn in your ai-aieeyeeeyyyes" (with a high kick on the initial aii) (ok not a kick with his legs, i mean a high note) but I can't find it right now.

Here is the "american" music video (whatever that means... I think it means they had to cut it a little shorter?). They are missing a few bits in the middle bridge-thing--the riff doesn't get played as many times (they don't have the bass go to the lower note) but I like the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi_BMvZUtLM . Also, I like the one for Starlight a lot. I was initially disinclined to like the one for Time is Running Out because it is reminiscent of other videos with a horde of people dancing awkwardly in a circle (the two that come to mind are "around the world" and uh, "ana ng?" is that right?), and I feel like the stuff with the rhythm and the formal military behavior could have been a lot cooler, but I like how they all fall down. Falling down is funny. Hysteria (the british version) frightens me. =( The one for Supermassive Black Hole is just too weird for me. Of course, the Knights of Cydonia one is too awesome for words. I wonder if they had to shorten Knights for american radio? Angela says she hears it all the time. This makes me happy. My fanaticism runs deep but I'm still very much a "new" Muse-lover; I'm not very knowledgable about them. I said to A that when you just look at Matt he's not that hot, it's only because he sings and is crazy. I have changed my mind because of those collared white button-up shirts, unbuttoned at the cuffs, or with sweaters. Chris used to be skinny? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_WmoCAD6KY&NR

Since the Download Festival (http://www.downloadfestival.com) will clearly not be enough, I need to go to the Muse concert in Davis: Thursday 9/28/2006 7:30 pm ARC Pavilion http://ticketing.concertmaps.com/muse/ . What does it mean when presale is sold out? That there will be regular sales at some point... right?
