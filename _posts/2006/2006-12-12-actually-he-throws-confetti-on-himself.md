i uploaded blue caravan, seattle nov 2005: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h1wMVTbI3Q
i can't find the other videos i took at that concert =( and i don't even remember what else i recorded. i think i also got the one where david berkeley came out and sang with her, and http://viennateng.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1065 tells me that was during the tower.

i just broke down and bought the new assassin off of muse.mu. drm is for nubs: the faq on the website even says "burn it to CD, then rip it using iTunes to play it on your ipod." stupid, stupid record companies. you can stream it here: http://judytuna.vox.com/library/audio/6a00c22529c75d604a00cd970406034cd5.html
THEY'LL TRY TO STEAL YOUR LIIIIEIEIEIEIEIIIIIIFE
SO WATCH YOUR BAAAAAACK

i don't even know what .89 pounds is in dollars. i'm assuming it's not too much more than $1. i hope. in other news in the "Judy Spends Responsibly" department, i just found out i was just charged $79 for amazon prime a few days ago becuase of their "try prime for three months for free!" promotion and i forgot to cancel it in time. i've just cancelled my prime membership but i have yet to figure out if that means i get refunded. goddamn it.
--edited to add: they've refunded me. hooray!
