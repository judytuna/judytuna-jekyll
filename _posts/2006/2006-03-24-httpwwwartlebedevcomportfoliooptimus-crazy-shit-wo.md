http://www.artlebedev.com/portfolio/optimus/  crazy shit! wow, i can't believe nobody's thought of that before. maybe it's cuz it hasn't really been technically feasible to do it nicely and cheaply enough until now. i've seen plastic transparent covers that go over your entire keyboard to add on the "be pe me fe" "phonetic alphabet" used for Chinese to your keys (as well as a system of individual stickers to go on your keyboard, which is much more aesthetically appealing) but making  the actual KEYBOARD ITSELF have a changable DISPLAY... that is ... gosh, so ELEGANT!

edited to add that [that entire website](http://www.artlebedev.com/news/) is awesome. i love/hate it when i use "that that," because i'm afraid that people will think it's a typo, but then i look forward to mocking whoever thinks it's a typo.
