if you type in "hysteria bass" you get 500 ugly guys with varying degrees of shirtlessness and skill, but the one that knocks them all out of the water is this small, small child who also does a million other songs: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIb7erYTatM   . he's the only one i've seen that does the chorus perfectly. it's kind of ridiculous.

i am saving http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tfWHip68tM to study when i get an electric guitar. he makes supermassive look not that difficult.
