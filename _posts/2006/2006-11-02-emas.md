european mtv awards, which are happening now! "best alternative act" and starlight already up at muselive! LASERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! http://invictus.softmeg.com/forums.php?m=posts&q=19100

[edited to add: someone's taken the video and uploaded it to youtube as well: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wqKRUfKKIo
it's a shame the sound's so out of sync, but maybe someone else'll upload a better one over the next few days.]
[edited again to add: higher-quality avis uploaded! http://invictus.softmeg.com/forums.php?m=posts&q=19115 . too bad: nobody seemed to have captured the internet-only backstage quiz where a fan asked why matt made fun of dom's trousers when clearly his own are arguably worse]
i didn't watch it live online--i only just got the streaming to work /sigh i missed them by a few minutes. but those folks over at muselive are incredibly fast! they got it up moments after it happened live!!!! aw man i love the internet

and they must have been feeling good--they did it in the original key (usually for live performances they do it a half step down)

LASERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
