The Imogen Heap concert was fantastic! She’s really someone awesome to

watch live! Live looping, the performance, she’s funny and quirky and

dances about the stage and says funny things and really loves the

audience, her live versions soudn very different from the studio

versions, she’s a very good piano player and a very good singer

(obviously, but it’s more apparent live)… We saw all the songs Kid

Beyond did at the STarry Plough as I told you, except a new trance one which I didn’t like that much. I think I like

listening to Kid Beyond’s beatboxing a lot (it’s totally incredible)

but not his songs that much. They get old fast. Which is sad, I want

to like it, but I don’t really, it’s just too much noise and sometimes

there are very slight tuning issues when he harmonizes with himself

because it’s all live. And I don’t really like the melodies he chooses

for his songs. However, Imogen Heap’s usage of live looping is totally

different and vastly superior, even for her songs that are just like

Kid Beyond’s only in that she uses just her voice and no other

instruments (there was only one song like that, where she only used

her voice and a live-looper. There was one other song where she uses

only her voice and a vocoder: Hide and Seek, of course.) I want a

vocoder so bad. It looks like SO MUCH FUN to fuck around with. And a

piano! Imogen Heap has such a cool voice. I feel sort of like I never

want to sing again, because my voice is so bland and uninteresting and

offkey and whiny and nasally but yet I have dreams of it being good,

so I feel like it can never be as good as I wish it was. Haha. I also

feel so uncreative, like there’s nothing in me. I told you I would

write you a song, but I don’t know how! And some songs are so

incredibly simple, 3 chords, a simple melody, but they’re so

effective. How do they do it? I guess I must study songs, learn to

play them, learn what chord progressions work, learn more chords to

begin with… I think I do have a skill, and that’s harmonizing. I’m

very very good at harmonizing, if given a melody. I just suck at the

melody part, or coming up with anything original. Anyway, blah blah

blah. For some songs it was just her onstage, and she’d go back and

forth between all this equipment–her “parrot” as she called her

live-looping machine-thing, and like four midi keyboards (one was a

red keytar), and one electric keyboard attached to a clear

piano-shaped box lined with lights (fantastic!!!!), and an instrument

that I don’t know. I really have no idea what it was. Alex says it was

a “thumb piano” and it’s wires. ???? She’d play a bit on that, then

start a pre-recorded sequence using a midi keyboard, and sing, and

then harmonize with herself, and then play the piano. For some songs

she had varying numbers of people on stage. There was one really

extremely dorky guy who played a midi sequencer, the double bass, and

the french horn. There was one percussionist who played a xylophone, a

ridiculously tiny drum “kit” … no really, it was tiny, each “drum”

and “cymbal” was smaller than your palm. I’m serious. I thought it

MUST have been electronic drum pads or something, but Alex says

they’re really acoustic, just incredibly small, and miked really well.

That thing was cool. And they clearly had differnt pitches too. Anyway

he also played a regular drumkit. Then sometimes the first guy who

opened (who I missed mostly. I only caught part of his last song. I

was late to teh warfield, sad) came out and played electric guitar.

And sometimes Kid Beyond came out and sang a harmony or beatboxed.

That was pretty darn cool. Actually it was straight-up fantastic.

She played “Let Go” totally acoustically, on the piano, and the dude

played the double bass along with her. It was so beautiful. Gosh,

that’s such a good song.

I had good seats. The standing seats were sold out by the time I got

my act together to buy tickets, but I got tickets that were in the

center, in the second row of the upper (seated) level. So that was

fun. And I’m glad that I wasn’t standing, because I’d have gotten

tired, and since I was on the upper level I could see everything

better. The drawback of course is that it’s harder to dance. =)
