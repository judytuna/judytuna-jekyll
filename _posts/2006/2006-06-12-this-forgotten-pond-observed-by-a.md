      <p>by the way, i never called you back. i got some locking nuts (i kept calling them bolts, stupidly, even though i KNOW the difference between a nut and a bolt) at ace hardware, and they work perfectly. i now have a bed that is raised up off of the floor again. HUZZAH FOR LISA AND HER GENIUSNESS</p>
