      <p>heya kris. thank you. i just got some creamy soup and i do feel a little better =)</p>
      <p>by "that song" do you mean "stockholm syndrome" and by "you guys" do you mean "spot the octopus" ? for i am confused. haha. if indeed my assumptions are correct, then hooray, and you should thank angela for she is the one that arranged it. and if not then which song are you thinking of? hehe. also, please listen to muse. i beg you. and then make all your friends listen to muse. i love them so much. hey, they have three of their newer songs on their myspace http://www.myspace.com/muse , let me tell you about them: the only single from their latest album that has come out in the US so far is "knights of cydonia," which is awesome and ridiculous and has a crazy epic queenesque chorus and an unstoppable guitar riff. the singles that have come out in the UK are the ultrapoppy "supermassive black hole," which is the kind of song that makes you want to get up against a pole (not kidding), and the also poppy "starlight," (which is a bit of the strokes and a bit of u2 and has an addictive melody), both great songs though sort of atypical of muse (but they've got a huge range). one thing i love about them is the piano, which they didn't use as much on the latest album as they have in the past. of note in particular is the song with a gorgeous piano riff in the middle: "butterflies and hurricanes," off of absolution (their third album; black holes and revelations is their fourth), so here is a recent performance of it when they headlined at reading: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnbiEoEd6jU   ... i don't even know if you like rock? haha. anyway, i am frighteningly in love with this band and i can't understand why still so many people in america don't know them at all. haha.</p>
      <p>anyway, i hope that you discover some chances to show off your costume =) what is it?</p>

      <p>Actually, I meant La Grippe, from back when you were in DeCadence (that was like 5-6 years ago tho, so it's understandable you thought I was talking about Muse.)  But I'll give them a listen, if for no other reason than to understand when you make long posts about them. :)</p>

      <p>I'm sorry,  also other people around me who have gotten sick: Alan and half of my lab group.  I'd like to think that it wasn't me, that it was just my immune system that weakened first! =P  I hope you feel better.  I'm mostly ok, with an occasional alarming cough.</p>
