There are two among you, fair readers, who would derive special amusement from this post: http://community.livejournal.com/ucberkeley/2088277.html
One is [lemmingsolution](http://lemmingsolution.livejournal.com/) for her love of squirrels; the other is [shigi](http://shigi.livejournal.com/) for her... um... not love for them.

Another thing that [lemmingsolution](http://lemmingsolution.livejournal.com/) should be interested in is this: http://theweeklycomic.com
Remember how my roommate is doing http://www.sproutcomics.com/ ? Yes, he's still doing that, but that is a long-term project, and now he's also doing a separate smaller weekly comic thing! So! Enter it! Because it is fun! Sometimes I don't know why I don't just write emails to people. But I want to tell everybody! And writing an email AND putting it in my journal is redundant!

I've had a headache all day and just now I started sneezing uncontrollably! Hooray!
