      <p>I liked the tap dancing, but she's not very good at lip synching which made it harder to enjoy the song, even with trying to ignore the totally over-produced over-filtered stuff, and that she is being a stripper.</p>

      <p>Her dancing is weird--I agree, it looks kind of like a stripper who's had too much coffee, the song is pretty awful, and also, I have to say--suspenders are probably the most unsexy clothing item, especially on someone as unsexy as she is.</p>
