LFG [Video Games Live](http://www.videogameslive.com), Friday, March 24, 2006 at the San Jose Arena (tickets 20-55 from [tickemaster](http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1C003C23D2AF9232?artistid=976815&majorcatid=10001&minorcatid=52)). Need dps/casters/transportation from Berkeley (so... mage? or warlock to summon? or someone to give me 800g for an epic mount?). Please PST (ATM machines PIN numbers RAM memory RAS syndrome).

No, seriously, I want to go to this. And you guys do too.
