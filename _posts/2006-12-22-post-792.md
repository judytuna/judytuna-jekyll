Yay mailing lists! Look what was in my email inbox!

[](http://www.muse.mu/cityofdelusion/flash.htm)

City of Delusion! WITH A REAL LIVE TRUMPETER!! And Matt on an acoustic guitar (and a ridiculous flailing scarf-thing)! Downloadable for the ipod and psp! haha. Do people really use the psp for videos?

Look at this: http://www.awesomestart.com/worldofwarcraft/

Itâ€™s like a wallpaper for your homepage! Because you can never have enough mass-marketed consumerism-personalized-branding-things!

[Some](http://www.awesomestart.com/animalcrossing/) [are](http://www.awesomestart.com/worldofwarcraft/) [awesome](http://www.awesomestart.com/jurassicpark/)! Others are rather [uninspired](http://www.awesomestart.com/muse/)! Makes me want to make my own! Time to study view page source! google.com/custom ??

Vienna show in sf tomorrow night!

Moving!
