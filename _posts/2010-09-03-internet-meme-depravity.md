first, you have to know what [mormon bubble porn](http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2010/09/02/meet-the-bubbleator) is (no actual nudity, but eh, not really sfw still i guess, it's really creepy. don't put images of yourselves at the beach on the internet guys)

then you can appreciate this mormon bubble porn of jp and day9 =D

i loves day9 and hdstarcraft!!

also have i posted here yet that there&#039;s a video on the internet where day9 explains the number of board positions in the board game "gentlemen of the south sandwich islands" using stars and bars? http://day9fan.com/whoisday9

in like 2003 or whatever, when in dan garcia&#039;s game theory research group, i was doing mancala, right, and i was walking home after decadence rehearsal with peterson, and i suddenly came up with using stars and bars to hash board positions (the old way we had was terrible cuz it included tons of impossible board positions, like 20 pieces in each hole)

and here is DAY9 USING STARS AND BARS TOOO! WE HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON CLEARLY HE SHOULD MARRY ME

he majored in math at harvey mudd. i almost went to harvey mudd! man, if i had gone to harvey mudd, maybe i could have been friends with day9 ommggg!!!!

hahahahaha
