My sister graduated from college on Friday! My whole family flew out to Boston on Wednesday night. Taking the red-eye is brutal.

The theme for the baccalaureate on Thursday was hoops, and it was a beautiful ceremony–lots of memories. The speaker at the commencement on Friday was [Melissa Harris-Perry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Harris-Perry), and here’s [an official video of her speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JO4mepx-7vU). 

We got to hang out with extended family–we had a meal at the [Wayside Inn](http://www.wayside.org/) since we have family history there. We spent some time at the [Grist Mill](http://www.wayside.org/history/gristmill) too. I have all these dreams of doing those “then and now” photos from reddit, but our clothes and poses aren’t the same. haha. We also ate at [a Chinese restaurant in Boston](http://www.yelp.com/biz/asian-garden-boston) ([dragon shrimp](http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=worddict&wdrst=1&wdqb=lobster)!)

We just got back to California tonight, with sister and luggage in tow. Had a [late dinner](http://www.yelp.com/biz/happy-house-restaurant-san-jose) with addons Fritz, Yvonne, and Daniel since they’re all in the south bay for Fanime. 

So exhausted. Leaving for Berlin on Tuesday O_O
