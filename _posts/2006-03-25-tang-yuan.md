I just made some [tang yuan](http://zhongwen.com/d/180/x246.htm): sesame rice balls. Here is some [recipe](http://chowtimes.com/2006/03/glutinous_rice_ball_with_sesam.html) I found on the internet; I am, however, not sure if I have ever eaten tang yuan made from scratch in my life. We get 'em frozen.

I assumed that the package says "tang yuan" on the front, but what I thought was "tang" looks a little different from what is displayed on zhongwen.com and what I assumed would be "yuan" does not look like "yuan" at all. So I dunno what it says. It's not a simplified-traditional difference because zhongwen.com displays the traditional first, then simplified in brackets. Hmm.

I got these at Ranch 99 like a billion years ago and never opened the package till now. They were yummy.

Of course, I haven't done my laundry or started to pack yet.
