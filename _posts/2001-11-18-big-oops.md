that was in my profile. it was too classic to give up. i had to archive it somewhere. i'm a big dork.

i lost joan's cell today. watching the meteor shower. i shoudl have just been satisfied with going to my rooftop. 

i'm going to climb up that mountain hill we went up to just now tomorrow when there's light and look for it. i turned it off too. 

i'm bummed.

aba banquet was last night, it was a lot of fun. i'm officially boy-crazy, yeah, so what else is new. i'm glad i went last night. i'm not so glad i went tonight to watch meteors.
