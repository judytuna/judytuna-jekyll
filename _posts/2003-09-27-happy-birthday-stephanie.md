last night i went to FAZ restaurant-turned-club for stephanie (and jacklyn). happy 21st you two! i went with my other roommates susan and connie and some lynbrook people too so we had a big lynbrook corner going on. it was great to dance with stephmoo, serena, adam and kenji. kenji's a little manwhore when he turns on his flashing necklace. maria and joan were there too. it's fun to watch joan on her turns--she looks really professional there, in her element, animated and focused.
