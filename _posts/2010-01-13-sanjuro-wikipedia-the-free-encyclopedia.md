> ***Sanjuro*** (椿三十郎, ***Tsubaki Sanjūrō***?) is a 1962 black and white [Japanese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjuro/wiki/Cinema_of_Japan) [samurai film](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjuro/wiki/Samurai_film) directed by [Akira Kurosawa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjuro/wiki/Akira_Kurosawa) and starring [Toshirō Mifune](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjuro/wiki/Toshir%C5%8D_Mifune). It is a [sequel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjuro/wiki/Sequel) to Kurosawa's previous film [Yojimbo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjuro/wiki/Yojimbo_%28film%29), with Mifune reprising his role as a wandering [ronin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjuro/wiki/Ronin). The film combines action and humour, and is lighter in tone than its predecessor.

    via [en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjuro) We watched this tonight. It was entertaining. My mom had a beautiful red camellia tree.
