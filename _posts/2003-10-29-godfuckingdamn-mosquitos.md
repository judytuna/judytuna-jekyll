i like how prof flight keeps telling us how wonderful we sound. it makes us feel loved. today we ran the "big brahms" for the first time (concert on sunday! 3pm first cong. church (corner of dana and channing)) and he was like, "i won't say a word!" then 30 seconds into it he says "nice!!!" appreciatively. he's so cute!

i played with two kittens today! KITTENS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sneeze sneeze sneeze itch.

i go through phases of rabid lj updating.

somebody please play settlers with me. or warcraft. oh wait, school? what's that?
