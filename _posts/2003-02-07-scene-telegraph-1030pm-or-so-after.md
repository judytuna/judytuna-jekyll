scene: telegraph, 10:30pm or so, after eating naan&curry, during a conversation about watching a person get piercings in various parts of their body:

(loudly) "and it wasn't because i was sexually interested--"
(some random guy off the street) "YOU SURE?"
"PRETTY SURE"

hahahaa. i spit out my piece of naan.
