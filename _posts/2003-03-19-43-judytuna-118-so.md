43  judytuna   -   -   1.18
so i'm 43rd out of 113. i'm proud!
the dashes mean my program didn't do the first two files in less than a minute (or they did but the output was wrong... but it probably took more than a minute). over a megabyte (a thesaurus), over a hundred kilobytes (romeo and juliet), and about 10 kilobytes (the declaration of independence). so my little program did the 10kb one in 1.18 seconds. hooray!
