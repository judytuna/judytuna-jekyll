Linked from [Muselive](http://www.muselive.com/index.php?m=single&id=4481), which I’ve started reading again now that there’s a new album in the works: *Speaking to BBC 6 Music, Bellamy revealed the record’s sound could see the band abandoning their traditional rock leanings completely. “A symphonic album has turned up here, like a full collaboration with an orchestra,” he said.*

“There’s definitely a few things on the album which are segueing into each other and it’s all very orchestral, but that could take over the album, so it could actually be kind of classical act basically, and move away from rock all together.
