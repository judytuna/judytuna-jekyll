-------------------------------------------
(i made it say [our decadence email address] so that we won't get more spam as a result of me complaining about spam in the internet, the most public of places)

anyway i was thrown into a fit of rage at those last two lines of the email. do they REALLY assume that we are STUPID enough to think that we actually wrote them an email and asked how they were doing? FUCKING HELL AUUUUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I HATE SPAM I HATE IT I I HATE IT I HATE IT AUGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

we get spam advertising lamps that has a line at the bottom that says "This is not an unsolicited email. If you wish to be removed from our broadcast please click here" and the "click here" link is "mauilto:remove@idm.net.lb" ... i bet they fucking misspelled "mailto" on purpose so that poor emailers who don't know how to see the content of a link (i look in the status bar) don't know waht to do when they click on it and it says "eudora doesn't know what program to open mauilto with" ... "this is not an unsolicited email" AUGH MAKE ME BARF!

we also keep getting spam that ADVERTISES SPAMMING SERVICES with a line at the bottom that says ... well, i deleted all of them (i'm sure, however, i'll have another one in my box soon that i can paste from), but they say something like "this is not Spam. it is in compliance With the Goverment sec tion 303.1" or some such shit "that says Emailings are not Spam if there Is a Remove link. click here to remove. we honor all remove requests" ... so i email them with the subject "remove [our address]" and it keeps getting bounced back: 

Your message cannot be delivered to the following recipients:

  Recipient address: elierizq@ims-ms-daemon
  Original address: remove@idm.net.lb
  Reason: Over quota

FUCKING HELL! they probably did that ON FUCKING PURPOSE! 

then again, i seriously doubt that they're intelligent enough to think of a scheme like that. it's probably just overwhelmed with remove requests and fucking sobig.f. FUCKING EMAIL, I HATE IT

also note, idm.net.lb ... so, with a law against spam now, which i know nothing about and guess i can research if i was feeling not-lazy (but not-not-lazy enough to write a lj rant), can i take legal action of some sort?

i'm ambivalent about clicking the "remove" link things. 
1) i think they're all fake. especially when you fill out your email address at a website... it must just save that email address and send more spam to it
2) replying (whether to a remove address or to the sender to tell them to stop, etc) only confirms that you're alive and that your account works, so they'll sned more spam to it
but 3) i'm desperate enough for it to fucking stop that i'll try anything

and my biggest question of all, do they actually do business with people? if they do, there must be some real fucking stupid people out there, since they're just setting themselves up for identity theft. i mean i know that frauds aren't the only way for your identity to get stolen, but still, it's just asking for it. i was talking with [lemmingsolution](http://lemmingsolution.livejournal.com/) during sproul tabling and we wondered if those people who go door to door saying "come to our church and be saved, or you're going to go to hell" (jehovah's witnesses, but "those people" sounds more insulting, and i'm in an insulting mood (i like to comment on myself)) actually get converts, and they must, or else why would they do it at all. and that made me think of "that study" (in quotes becuase it's vague, i don't know if i'm remembering it right, i don't know what the study was called, it is not cold hard evidence) i learned in psych (or something... the more i think about it the more i think it might have been completely made up; what if it was just in some piece of fiction i read somewhere) where if you put a mouse (or hamster, or panda, or deer, or rabbit, or three-toed sloth) in front of a button and give it food every time it presses the button, it'll press it a lot for a while, but eventually get bored and stop, cuz it learns that every time the button is pressed food will come out. and if you never give it food, it'll stop too. but if you give it food randomly when it presses the button, it goes crazy and becomes totally obsessed with pressing the button, cuz food *might* come out of the hole in the shitty little cage the big bad scientists who are all so cruel to cute furry animals who never did evil humans no harm keep it in. so there might or might not be a hypothesis that humans are like that too, random stuff is more fun and you'll do something more times to hit the jackpot (of course that's true, without it the state of nevada would just be desert). the point is that this whole thing might be fake and i don't know shit, but that even though i don't know shit, i still hate spam and percieve myself as a better person than spammers. and after all this is my livejournal and i can say whatever the hell i want in it. thank you. i'm done now.
