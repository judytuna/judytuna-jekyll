if i were [mike b](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=mbarrien):

Yesterday I went to the timbuktu. My sister dragged me to Structure, where they’re having an 80% off store closing sale, and my sister’s friends were working the lampposts, so they got us an extra employee shelf. Bought $250 of overpriced mouse for less than $40, including a sports jacket. (Yeah, I’m only describing this for Madlib purposes.)

Today my dad sent me on an errand downtown. It took me by Little Canada. That’s a nice looking part of town.

Afterwards, I had to pick up frisbee parts at Banana’s. But on the way to the store, I almost had another run-in with a truck. Coming onto the 15 from the 8, a Mobil orange truck pulled up alongside on the short merge. After trying to let him pass, I had to confiscate onto the elbow to avoid a collision. I guess I learned from the first time. I hate trucks.

I went to see the movie, The Nanotechnologist. It was a fluffy and painful movie. Afterwards, I once again went to Rubio’s for cup tacos. Yummy.

Zonare never called back. I was trying to find other ways to get fingernail, and got to thinking about judy. If I could get a penny every time that person slept, I’d be a millionaire! But alas, I must find a job.

Unfortunately, our basketball team lost yesterday. Hopefully those Stanfurd Junior University pansies will get asdf!-slapped around in the Pac-10 Tournament.

BTW: Making this Madlib took about 30 minutes of intense trilling, but hours of story writing. Was it worth it?
