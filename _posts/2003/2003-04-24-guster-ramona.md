      <p>Re: mindless drivel</p>
      <p>it rolls of the tongue well. mindless drivel. mindless drivel. mindless drivel. maybe the repeated "l" and "d" and "i" sounds, and the two trochees...</p>

ramona. 
where have you been??
i couldn't go to sleep till you came in.
ramona,
you're miss oklahoma,
and you miss oklahoma. [HAHA]
i'll get you what you want. 

cuz there were days
when i refrain
from brightening our corner [???]
of hickory lane
when you would sing that song for me
just like your favorite singer.

why'd you have to be so nice?
a wink and a girly smile.
why'd you have to punch my arm? [eye???]
that was something.
but did you want me to stay? [i used to think it was "what did you want me to say?" but after listening to it 100 more times...]

[ooh, i love the guitar.]

when i was younger and thought of myself
i never dreamed i'd become like this!
a snap of your fingers and into the argument
anything for you now

[ooh, more electric guitar!!!]

cuz there are days 
when i refrain 
to brighten our corner
of hickory lane
when you would sing that song for me
the only one you know!
but i know now
we're not at the start [???]
we're going to pieces
we're falling apart
so come and sing that song for me
just like
your favorite singer.

it's on their upcoming cd. it's not even released yet! i love this song. they played it at their concert. i was really happy. ryan showed it to angela and me one day and said he wanted to arrange it. perhaps. thank you ryan. for getting me into guster and stuff.

my sister is here! she's on spring break. she came up today. she's visiting for a few days, tagging along with me to class and stuff. 

i've been "backdating" more entries because i don't want to clutter up friends pages with mindless drivel that is meant more for myself than anything else. but i'm not making it "private" cuz like, i want other people to appreciate the goodness of guster, if they so desire, but i won't push it on them. that's a good phrase, mindless drivel. mindless drivel. mindless drivel.
