Diskeeper has completed a defragmentation run on this volume and there remain 57 fragmented files and/or directories and 212 excess fragments.  (There were 5387 excess fragments before the defragmentation run, and now there are 96% less.)

The average number of fragments per file is 1.00.

On average, you have 0% excess fragments per file on this volume.  This is a slightly fragmented volume.  You should use the Smart Scheduling option in Diskeeper to automatically keep fragmentation at a low level. Click the Set It and Forget It button in the Diskeeper display to set up a Smart Schedule, or to confirm whether any schedules are set.
