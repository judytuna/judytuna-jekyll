      <p>Cherries are the hardest illusion to pack. You must hold the cherry, and then, quickly, PACK it!</p>

      <p>as you can see around me, S-B-C.</p>
      <p>nono. you must put the cherry in front of you, put the carrot-mirage in front of the cherry, and when the cherry is not looking, PACK IT, quickly!</p>

      <p>do you know how long i stared at that one? i still don't believe it... but i do, of course, because they say so, and after all they are scientists... it's just that... i don't. you know. i sat in front of my monitor covering up the rest of the board with my hands and they still looked like different shades of grey =)</p>

      <p>Re: yeah!</p>
      <p>Actually yeah it looked so ridiculous that my officemate and I actually opened the image up in the GIMP (like Photoshop) and compared the colors... yep they're exactly the same. Insane!</p>

      <p>Re: yeah!</p>
      <p>omg that is blowing my mind!  It really wasn't at all believable that those were the same color, but I covered the rest of the image up with random windows and they do look like the same color!  Holy crap.  But when I removed the windows they looked different again to the point of disbelief (again).</p>
