i dreamed that i was battling a guy in stripes and greased hair with a bunch of knives. and then i wasn't the one fighting with him, i was watching it. you know how dreams are. he rolled around and smacked his arm to the ground in an effort to bash in the face of whoever he was fighting, but instead the opponent had rolled away and instead there were a few knives (like, butcher knives) on the ground so when he smacked his arm on them his arm got cut into a few pieces, so when he lifted his arm, it fell off of his shoulder.

the explanation for this dream: i watched "gangs of new york" right before i went to sleep. it's a bad movie. tries to do too many things at once.

of course "better" really isn't saying much.
