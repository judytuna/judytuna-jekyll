yesterday, i had a u chorus rehearsal and didn't tell anyone. lack of planning made it so that a&a left before i finished figuring out if i was going to join them, and therefore i am Supreme Lameness because if i had figured out three hours before that i wasn't going, ryan would have driven down. so he will come to the bay area today. so i drew on my face with eyeliner and this crappy blue glittery stuff i've had from halloween concert last year that was really greasy and put on purple pants and voila, [night elf](http://www.blizzard.com/war3/wallpaper/wallpaper23.shtml). i wish i got pictures of myself. i went to [lordkrishna](http://lordkrishna.livejournal.com/)'s party where i only know one other person (hi [berkeleyjew](http://berkeleyjew.livejournal.com/)!) and we played a few abortive rounds of taboo, ate hershey's kisses, and solved mathish-logicish puzzles. with infinitely intelligent pirates. and smurfs with black or white hats. and then k and i and a guy whose name is not brandon went to happy donuts, where we were happy because we got free donut holes.

hurrah!
