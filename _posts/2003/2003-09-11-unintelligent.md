bla bla bla. today as i sat in 45a lecture, i heard the following conversation behind me.
left: amanda has the most sexual frustration out of anyone i know, and she doesn't even know she's that sexually frustrated.
right: i wish i'd told her not to go to the crap art school in san francisco, but i didn't and now she's here.
left: at least she got out of sd. maybe now she can get laid.

what, is it so hard to get laid in sd or something? very strange. also strange was the cryptic precursor to that exchange about "ill shit" and "tricks."

my jr seminar professor is nice. i want to sit at his feet and let him fill my brain with little points about the text.
