"i noticed that you only update when you're procrastinating, when you're bored, or when you've had a really memorable IM conversation."
~francesca aka [rawkvixen](http://rawkvixen.livejournal.com/)

i guess it's true.

i'm working on chronicling the ski trip but i'm trying too hard to put down details and really, there's no need to.

i'm also *still* working on "angels without wings." 

i saw a [guster](http://www.guster.com) concert last night. it was GREAT! 

(and they covered a ben folds song--not the same!)
