      <p>I love the Engrish-site, it totally cracks me up.  I think my favorite one is Men's Pocky... just the idea that they have a separate snack for men, hehe...</p>

      <p>check it out, some good fobulisms. there's stuff on that page that I found outside of engrish.com too.</p>
      <p>Whenever my friends visit Taiwan or Japan, I always tell them to bring me back some fobby stationary.  so.. I've built up a pretty decent collection of it.  I should really get them scanned and posted on the web one of these days.  In the meantime, here's a sampling:</p>
      <p>"I will always be there for you I promise you with these five words when you breath, I'll be there as an oxygen..."</p>

      <p>Actually, Men's Pocky is rather widely available, and is super good. I think it may be called "Men's" because it's dark chocolate, which I supopse is more manly because it's bittersweet, rather than just plain sweet.<br />
      Mmmm... dark chocolate.... *drools*</p>

      <p>hahaha... my dad is so funny about sweets.  He was saying how in Japan it's not manly to like really sweet stuff; only dark chocolate is acceptable.  But sometimes we catch him sneaking chocolate cake and stuff... hehehe...</p>
