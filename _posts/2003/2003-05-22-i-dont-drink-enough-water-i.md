      <p>I think the more concerning thing is not his obssession with that controller, but the fact that you were FREAKING CHATTING ON IM AND POSTING ON LJ AT 4 IN THE MORNING!!!! :-)</p>

i don't drink enough water. i don't get enough sleep. i don't feed myself regularly. a schedule for myself i don't keep. oh shut up judy and stop trying to rhyme your complaints. 

today i wrote some. then elanor jenny chloe lily and i ate at party sushi for like more than an hour, and when we finally got around to commencing actual study-group activities it was 10:40pm... so we went home.

today connie moved in! 

my sinuses are TOTALLY PLUGGED. i tried washing them out with warm salt water. it was a rather unpleasant experience.
