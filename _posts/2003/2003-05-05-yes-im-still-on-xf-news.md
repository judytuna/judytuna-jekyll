      <p>Have you heard the Catatonia song, "Mulder and Scully"?  You probably have.  Well, it's on my "Live Forever" Britpop compliation album that I bought @ Hethrow airpor that I luuuuuuurve.  Not that song though.  That song is kinda annoying.  But it made me happy to see it anyway.</p>

the wonderful things you learn from the xf-news mailing list: there's a busta rhymes song called "i know what you want" featuring flipmode squad and mariah carey that has a line that goes "we're like scully and mulder/ walking shoulder to shoulder" 

scully and mulder make me happy
