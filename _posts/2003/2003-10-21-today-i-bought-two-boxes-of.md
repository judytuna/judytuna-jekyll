      <p>I love Honey Bunches of Oats! But mostly the regular (Honey) kind.. almonds, etc. are overkill.</p>

      <p>really.. what would we ever do if walgreens wasn't our neighbor?<br />
      1) we'd starve to death<br />
      2) connie would have nothing to look forward to saturday nights</p>
