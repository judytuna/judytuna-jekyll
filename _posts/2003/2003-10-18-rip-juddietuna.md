so i tried signing on to AIM with juddietuna as usual, and it said juddietuna was suspended. so i clicked more info, which bought me to http://www.aim.aol.com/errors/SUSPENDED.html?ccode=us&lang=en

yeah, juddietuna used to be an AOL screenname; i haven't signed on to it with AOL since 1st year of college, and i think that's about when we terminated the account, anyway. i've had juddietuna since beginning of high school, i think. it's a part of my identity. that i cannot use it anymore makes me  exceedingly sad. (why did it work all the way until now?)

anyway. i just registered "iamatunasandwich" which is a passable alternative.
