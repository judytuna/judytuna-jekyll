yuukai (11:46:42 PM): Exploding Starred and feath-herd of cattle-pult-er-geiced-tea-ring wheel 
I'll be dar-ned's book storange counting to ten your own horn-et's 
nestraighten up and fly ritemiz-ipper is undone-eath the car-ton of sour 
CREAMTURE's aliva va voom-pa loompastrami sandwitchy the swordfishmael's 
categoreese's pieces of an exploding star

it's a little difficult to follow, i know, but if you were there, you'd understand that we were playing that game where you start off with a phrase and the next person uses the last sounds of the phrase to make a new one. other car games included telling each other stupid "i don't know" jokes that started off with the tried-and-true: what do you call a deer with no eyes? no ideer. what do you call a deer with no eyes and no legs? still no ideer. what do you call a deer with no eyes, no legs, and no genitalia? still no fucking ideer. 

what do you call a round pastry on top of a steven king novel? i donut-de-stand. what does a confused electrical repairman say? watt? what do you say when you're a clerk in a game store and you've run out of a customer's favorite came? no clue! 

NO CLUE!!!!!

we also listened to porcupine tree, stuck our arms out of the windows and flapped (coordination is key. when turning, you must bank accordingly), and played mental jeapordy. we said "look! a tree! whoa." in unison several times. 

of course in other cars there was the famous "lo le lo le lo le la" rhyming. the only significant one i remember is "peter is now riding bitch, wonders if you'd like to switch, lo le lo le lo le la, lo le lo le lo le la." if you can think of any more please leave them in the comments. this of course is only due to elanor's away message. what a poor memory i have.

and i held feet with ryan at rutabaga's for the first time. ah, tour.

elanor reminded me that george sent us an email documenting our experiences. including playing wise & otherwise! hahahahaahahahaha. and look, i figured out how to use lj-cut! but now how to make a link yet. i only get the generic "read more" thing. so click it --> 
From: George Fan
Subject: Wise & Otherwise

Fourth of all, everyone must check out http://www.homestarrunner.com/cantsayjob.html.

Fifth of all, people in the George-mobile, check the bottom of this email for "exploding star" and "dinosaur adventure" transcripts.

Sixth of all, I present you the best of Wise & Otherwise:

Big stones are… in my way, goddamnit!
Big stones are… too burdensome for some weak-minded woman to carry.  After all, she’s just a woman!
Big stones are… in my kidneys.  Woe is me and my big stones.
Big stones are… good insurance against Jehovah’s witnesses

While the sheep bleats… his heart is secretly yearning for Ireland.
