      <p>Don't feel too bad.  Basses seem to be in short supply this year, in almost every group.  You're not alone.</p>
      <p>hey, here's an idea: record your one bass singing a bassline, then play it back when you perform the song.  Voila, two basses!</p>

*cool*.

leftovers accumulate in the fridge and mold accumulates on the edges of the bathtub, but basses do not accumulate in decadence. i can hear very clearly and feel very slightly a bass line coming from a neighboring apartment. *uncool*.
