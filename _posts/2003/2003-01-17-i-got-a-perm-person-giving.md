      <p>YAY! =) THANKS!!! </p>
      <p>well, the haircut lady said "it will last at least a month" ... so, if i want it to stay this way, i guess. but it also takes $$$, which i would rather spend on... food. so we'll see.</p>

i got a perm. 

person giving me haircut: ah, now you look more like a young lady, not some little kid like you did before.
mom: i like it. i like it a lot.
sister: uhhhh...
brother: you remind me of jenny.
sister, again: judy you look uhhh..... interesting.
dad: it's very nice! you look older, not like some little kid like you did before. (but in chinese)
sister, yet again: very interesting. not like a freak... uhhh, just interesting. yeah. 
my boyfriend: i didn't recognize you.

i meant to put a wave in it. the lady said "if we use curlers that are too big, it will straighten out in 2 shampoos! and you want it to stay, or else why pay so much? so we use these curlers" and i said "derr, ok"

but i wanted a change. so i like it.
