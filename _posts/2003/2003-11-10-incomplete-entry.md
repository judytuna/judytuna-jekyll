i liked this sentence. "Lix crossed the river by the only open route, Deliverance Bridge, and drove around the park on Navigation Island through stands of tarbony trees and ornamental shrubs, through puddles, ankle deep, which dramatically accessorized his car with arched silver spoilers of rainwater, until he reached the second bridge, which still allowed some access to the river's eastern banks."
