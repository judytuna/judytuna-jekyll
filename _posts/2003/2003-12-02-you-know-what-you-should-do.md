      <p>hahaha yes. i love how you can see just how bad my posture is. but it's not my fault! we were really cramped up there! and i was taller than the people standing near me, AND i was in the first row! the music folders of the people next to me interfered with mine, so i had to hold mine lower, AND there was poor light, so i coudln't see it! hehe. and why am i the only one in the whole chorus that's smiling? why WAS i smiling anyway?</p>
