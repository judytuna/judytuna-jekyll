      <p>wow!! four times??!? i don't think i've ever watched a movie more than once in the theaters. not even titanic. (this ought to spur many people to tell stories like, "so i knew this guy whose friend's sister went to see titanic FOURTEEN TIMES in the theater, all in TWO DAYS!!!!" ... or better yet, "i went to see titanic FOURTEEN TIMES in the theater, all in TWO DAYS!!!" ...)</p>

      <p>I wanna time travel too! And I mean in the sense of going back in time, as opposed to merely violating rules of time/space, i.e., it'd be a lot cooler than those town portal scrolls.</p>

suesdanig (10:35:31 PM): the word nemore
suesdanig (10:35:36 PM): it has the name NEMO in it
suesdanig (10:35:38 PM): NEMOre

suesdanig (10:57:42 PM): How to kill a kid's excitement:

A company that manufactures equipment used to process sewage issued a press release Thursday warning that drain pipes do lead to the ocean -- eventually -- but first the fluid goes through powerful machines that "shred solids into tiny particles." 

"In truth, no one would ever find Nemo and the movie would be called 'Grinding Nemo,"' wrote the JWC Environmental company, which makes the trademarked "Muffin Monster" shredding pumps. 

In the unlikely event Nemo survived the deadly machines, the company added, he would probably be killed by the chlorine disinfection. 

you might notice that this was posted at 10:42pm. however, the last aim from sues was timestamped 10:57. what is going on, you ask? I TRAVELLED IN TIME
