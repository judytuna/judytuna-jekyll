Year 3000 by "busted" or something. this song became the anthem of the watermark camping trip. ok, "anthem" is taking it a bit far. let's just say that whenever someone said "one day," people said "i came home, at lunchtime..."

i still haven't heard the actual song. 

one day when I came home at lunchtime,
I heard a funny noise
went out to the back yard to find out if it was,
one of those rowdy boys.
stood there was my neighbour called peter,
and a Flux Capacitor.

he told me he built a time machine
like the one in a film I've seen,
yeah yeah... he said...

I went to the year 3000
not much has changed but they lived under water,
and your great great great grand daughter,
is pretty fine (is pretty fine)

he took me to the future in the flux thing and I saw everything,
boy bands and another one and another one ... and another one!
triple breasted women swim around town... totally naked!

we drove round in a time machine,
like the one in the film I've seen..
yeah yeah... he said...

I went to the year 3000
not much has changed but they lived under water,
and your great great great grand daughter,
is pretty fine (is pretty fine)

I took a trip to the yeah 3000
this song had gone multi platinum,
everybody brought our 7th album.
it had outsold Michael Jackson,
I took a trip to the year 3000
this song had gone multi platinum,
everybody brought our 7th album, 7th album.

he told me he built a time machine
like the one in a film I've seen,
yeah yeah... he said...
