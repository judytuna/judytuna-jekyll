i haven't posted anything in livejournal for WEEKS!!!!!!!! talk about major withdrawal!!! and this isn't even going to be a real post--it's just an email i wrote to my family about my maiden backpacking voyage!

We went to a place in 
the mountains near Tahoe (an hour drive from Ryan's house) with a 
bunch of lakes. The main lake is called Island Lake, and there were lots 
and lots of people camped there. That's only a 1 mile hike in though, so 
we went on ahead and looked for some other trail that goes at least 4 
miles in. We wandered around for a while, followed these dubious rock 
piles that we thought were marking the trail, and ended up on the top of 
this mountain in the midst of a granite field. (Granite is really cool! We saw 
a bunch of places where the granite was like peeling and stuff. Oh, and 
when we were driving back, we went through this valley and the sheer wall 
of granite on the other side was awe-inspiring. hehe) So yeah, the trail 
was really hard to follow because 1) it was very faint 2) the rock piles, 
while obviously made by humans, were kinda few and far between, not to 
mention the fact that we didn't know if they marked the trail we wanted to 
be on, and 3) there were a few large patches of snow that covered the 
trail. Yeah, snow. In June. hehe. So there were lots of little creeks 
because of the snow runoff. And there was lots of mud. It was really cool. 
I'm really glad I got these boots. I also really like my backpack--i think 
it's 
great! We saw a few families going to Island Lake for a day hike, and one 
of the moms asked me about my backpack because she wants to get the 
same one. My hipbones are a bit sore, but I suppose that is unavoidable 
when you hike around carrying stuff. So yeah. After wandering around that 
granite field for a while and getting really tired, we went back to where we 
knew where we were (was that phrase overcomplicated? hehe) and 
camped next to Round Lake. It was really nice there--the campsite was 
right on the lake, and there was a little rock pile in which to make a 
campfire, and stuff. The MSR stove that dad showed me how to use 
worked really well, and our freeze-dried food was way better than either of 
us expected (we had "pasta primavera" ... hehe). Yeah! It was fun. I've 
never had to dig my own latrine before, so that was an experience. 
hahaha. Oh! and Ryan picked up a frog hopping along by our tent--it was 
so tiny! After we put it back down, we could hear it and its friend croaking 
really close to us, and we shined our flashlight on it... it's hard to believe 
that such a big noise could come from such a tiny, tiny animal. It was 
seriously as long as my thumb. You could see this gigantic bubble (its 
throat sack, apparently?) hanging out of its mouth and on the water, and 
you could see its sides moving in and out. That was neat. We think we 
saw bats too. Anyway, I had a really good time and I'm looking forward to 
going backpacking with Raymond and Annie. Right ray and annie? =)

i spent many hours at REI recently. this resulted in a new[pack](http://www.rei.com/online/store/ProductDisplay?productId=47617031&storeId=8000&catalogId=40000008000&langId=-1) and [water bottle](http://www.rei.com/online/store/ProductDisplay?productId=6077480&storeId=8000&catalogId=40000008000&langId=-1) (in raspberry red. hi susan, i'm a trend slut!) and these really great [boots](http://www.rei.com/online/store/ProductDisplay?productId=12235149&storeId=8000&catalogId=40000008000&langId=-1) and a [pillow](http://www.rei.com/online/store/ProductDisplay?storeId=8000&catalogId=40000008000&productId=3963&parent_category_rn=4723203)... my brother and dad used to go camping a lot so they have a lot of camping stuff, so i salvaged a tiny little msr stove (msr stands for MULDER-SCULLY ROMANCE!... ok shut up judy) and this like pan and a tarp and a sleeping pad from this outdoor plastic storage shed in our backyard. salvaged is the operative word. anyway as you can tell i have been thinking "acquire backpacking gear and go backpacking" nonstop for the past week and a half or so. 

relay for life was yesterday; i went but didn't stay overnight. this band played and the lead singer looked familiar--turns out we were in this random production of godspell one summer. today i played some more zelda and ate some more sushi with my family. my mom gave me many oranges, many cherries, and a citrus juicer. summer school starts tomorrow.
