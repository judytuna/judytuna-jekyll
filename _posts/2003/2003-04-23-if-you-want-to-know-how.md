if you want to know how to fly high then go now to the place where all the concubines--
meet and converse with them marvel at their pale skin wonder how they chew on their pointy--
teeth and hair are beauty they know it's their duty to be countess in their hearts and their--
minds that have to whisper see in them a sister look into their eyes and you'll become
transylvanian concubine.
you know what flows here like
wine.
stay here with us, it's just time.
transylvanian concubine.
sorrow is their master cackling with laughter now he's having just one piece of--
cakey is their make-up catholics try to shake up all the things that form their lives, but they're--
dead their sighs their songs.
they know what they do is wrong.
stay here with us, it's just time.
transylvanian concubine.
candelabra's lighted satan has been sighted never has there been an evening like--
this is what they wanted always to feel hunted you can never be to rich or too--
thin. the blood has run out. 
fangs ruin any cute pout. 
morning has come now they've flown.
what have you learned from what has been shown?

hehe. what a freaky song. so one of my roommates olivia freshman year in good ol 8d26b used to play rasputina a lot, so i downloaded this song (transylvanian concubine) because i liked it. cellos are cool. she also played eminem (kim... goodness) and that song that goes "if you want to be happy for the rest of your life, don't make a pretty girl your wife. from my personal point of view, get an ug-a-ly girl to marry you" haha. man that was funny. and that rave song "i'll fly with youuuuuuuuuu" ... and of course all three of us played shaggy's "it wasn't me" all the time. ah the memories.
