I am a demanding English teacher.

 Which cat that thinks it's human are you?

is this quiz telling me something? is it revealing my future? maybe it is fate.

that sentence is surprisingly difficult to parse.

today in eng45a professor miller went off on a tangent on female saint's lives and that there is a long tradition in catholic texts of very erotic descriptions of women saints loving the body of christ. and then there is this one fascinating text about christina of markgate who, like st cecilia, tells her new husband that she doesn't want him to touch her because she has pledged herself to god, and he tries to pin her down but she manages to escape, and then he complains to his friends, who say "what? what kind of a man are you, can't even handle a woman in your own bedroom?" so they all go in and help him get her, but she gets away again and has to hide in a hermit's cell for a bunch of years. and finally she said "how did you guys get me off on catholic erotica?"
