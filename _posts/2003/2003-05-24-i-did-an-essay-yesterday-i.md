i did an essay yesterday. i ended up with 12 full pages. i did the last 10 pages in about 8 hours. it was also--you guessed it!--two weeks late.

"hi judy
i got your paper and just read it.  it's very good!"

**WTF?** maybe she's just saying that and maybe i'm being arrogant in becoming happy that she thinks it's "very good," but even so, that does it: my brain is much better at cramming for english than it is for cs. what am i trying to prove by taking cs classes anyway? it is time to decide what i want.

*seriously*

if i just DID THINGS ON FUCKING TIME everything would be so much better

somebody carve off my nose with a scimitar and let my sinuses dry out quick before i do it myself I HATE THE MONTH OF MAY
