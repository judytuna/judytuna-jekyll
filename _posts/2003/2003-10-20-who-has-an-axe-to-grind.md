delete "iamatunasandwich" because i chose "juddietunafish" instead.

i cannot decide if "starcnomics," using starcraft phrases to teach english, or the jay chou song is the best: http://www.blizzard.com/insider/017/overseasmerchandise.shtml

itunes is nice. i bought hotel paper (michelle branch) on a whim. the download was fast--i didn't clock it officially, but the thirteen tracks completed download well within the timespan it took to play three songs on a radio station (in itunes). i'm going to make use of the radio. if i were a millionaire i would make an internet radio station for college a cappella! why hasn't somebody else? because nobody would listen to it? i like that if you sort by "album" it's smart enough to sort the song tracks by track number. i don't like that the default system to save files is by artist folder, album folder, track number and song title filename. i've always preferred to have everything in the filename. 

things inconsequential.

father dick said to me, calm down. being perturbed isn't going to get you anywhere. ok. upon self-reflection, neither is being overapolagetic for "things that i might think other people might think are my flaws." haha. hang-ups galore.
