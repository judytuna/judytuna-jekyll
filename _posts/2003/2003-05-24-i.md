i got an A on my paper. an A! an A!!! an A!!!!

to think what wonderful creations i could make if i spent more time on them.

apparently everybody wrote one of their imitation/parody poems on gertrude stein, so they compiled them all and made copies of it and called it "lifting stien: an anthology" and gave them to us... it's sooooo funny!! hi, elanor and jenny. 

this was a great class. you should take it if you can. eng131--modern american poetry. =)
