DAVID DUCHOVNY IS 'SEX' BOUND
Former "The X-Files" hunk David Duchovny is to enjoy saucy romps with "Sex and in the City" star Sarah Jessica Parker in the final episodes of the hit show.

David's part sees him enjoy some highly personal encounters with Sarah's character, Carrie Bradshaw.

A spokeswoman says, "They'll enjoy a very full sexual relationship."
