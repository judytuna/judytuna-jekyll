These are my siblings, Raymond and Annie. Annie just got home from Japan--she's been there since May for study abroad. We were definitely overdue for some silliness.

This is me locked in epic combat with a member of our extended family. He is a very fierce competitor. Just look at those kicks.

My favorite moment is him taunting me after a win. hahahahaha
