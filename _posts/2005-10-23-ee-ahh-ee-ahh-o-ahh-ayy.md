am i awake? what time is it?

when i get through this day, can someone tell me how–and how much longer now–am i awake?

(the coffee’s cold. did i forget to drink it yet? did i forget? my clothes are wet. i don’t *remember* drinking it)

when i get through this part, will the next part be the same? will i be wondering if i’m awake?

(these are not the clothes i had on when i went to bed. and something else besides my head is growing from my head. and when i close my eyes it looks the same as when i open them again–am i awake? what time is it?)

is it that time again–wasn’t it already then? so does it have to be the time it was again? when i get through this day, can someone tell me how, and how much longer now, am i awake?

when i get through this day, can someone tell me how–and how much longer now–am i awake?
