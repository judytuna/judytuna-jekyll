today i went to the bathroom on 2nd floor eschelman. there are things written on the grout between the tiles in the stall. things like
- the grout wall of china 

- congraoutulations 

- this grout nation 

- grout it out 

- grouto marx (i just looked on google and there's some comedian named [groucho marx](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/g/a127858.html)

- grout expectations <~i might be making this one up... 

yeah.

today's **impulsive buys:**
1. yamaha speakers from the used computer store on shattuck. this store is kinda like a dump, but it has all kinds of random crap. these yamaha speakers are "new" but are at this place because they have a mail in rebate that expired in 2000. they suck, but are still better than my current speakers.

2. michael chabon's [*the amazing adventures of kevalier and clay*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312282990/qid=1050379155/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-2717834-7205421?v=glance&s=books&n=507846).

3. and i dropped off two things at the dry cleaner's today. you know i've never done that before (dry cleaning).
