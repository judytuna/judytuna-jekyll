Help me get a free ipod. Click this. http://www.freeiPods.com/default.aspx?referer=8286107

You will have to sign up and I think you have to do one of the promotions. There are a lot to choose from. You don't have to pay anything. I did the free 4-week trial of stamps.com because I like the idea of printing postage from my computer because I hate waiting in lines at the post office.

I really want an ipod. A lot.
