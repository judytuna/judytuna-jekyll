...which makes me very sad, i was hoping for a 3rd album! and i'd just fallen in love with them over the summer--yes i know i'm a little late! i remember doris was madly in love with them for a while there... once we were sitting in your kitchen and i was trying to sing harmony to truly madly deeply... and finally you couldn't take it anymore and said "YOU'RE SINGING IT TOO HIGH!!!" and i said weakly "but i was singing harmony??" ... evidently not very well!!! hehe =) i remember liking their songs a lot back then (and thinking that daniel jones was very good looking) but i'd never heard any of their not-single songs... yeah. so i'm a little slower than everybody else. 

my voice hurts and my eyes do too. i haven't worn my contacts at ALL since school started... it's been what, 6 weeks now? i need a new prescription desperately. in lecture... "what does that say? jal?" *sigh*

judy is being disjointed, don't mind her
