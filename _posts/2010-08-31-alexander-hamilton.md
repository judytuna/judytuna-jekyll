[maiki linked](http://lore.interi.org/forum/topic/ham-gangsta) this video, a rap about alexander hamilton:

I can’t help but feel [we got kind of one-upped here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38J8bpOxzwQ). (link goes to money money money lol) 

It’s weird how similar it is to [wubbakraken](http://wubbakraken.livejournal.com/)‘s, but I guess calling out the name is an established trope in joke hip-hop.
