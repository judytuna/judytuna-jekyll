Tonight, I made [Spot the Octopus](http://spottheoctopus.com) sing [two holiday carols](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/em3c4/league_of_legends_holiday_carols_anyone/) for [25MTS](http://25minstosurrender.podomatic.com)!

1. [Spot the Octopus – League of Legends Jingle Bells](https://judytuna.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/LOL-Jingle-Bells.mp3)

2. Twelve Days of Snowdown, but, uh, I can’t upload things > 2 mb. haha

Well, here they both are on Posterous, because it has a built-in flash player. [http://spottheoctopus.posterous.com/spot-sings-lol-holiday-carols](http://spottheoctopus.posterous.com/spot-sings-lol-holiday-carols)
