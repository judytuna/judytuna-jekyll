      Did somebody say my name?
      
      Sorry I didn't notice this earlier, and thanks for the link. I think I probably have a lot in common with your friend Kevin, and it's a testament to my skittishness here that I read and think, "Alright, alright, alright ... this sounds good, but surely there's something I'm missing."
      
      I'd like to first announce that I love the abbreviation "WEIRD," which I'd never heard before.
      
      As for the actual substance of the article, I think I'm in pretty full agreement. Maybe I wouldn't use the word "skittish," in favor of another one like "hesitant," but then I'm not sure that's better. I think acknowledging that the best solution is sometimes just the least bad solution is a good thing to do.

[maiki](http://interi.org), [Maira](http://mairasutton.net), [Parker](http://parkerhiggins.net), and other ironblogger-sf people: I think you'd like this article on reasoning by Kevin, who I went to college with: [Eager vs. Skittish Utilitarianism | melting asphalt](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/eager-vs-skittish-utilitarianism/).

I'd love to hear your thoughts, because you are also people that think about life and philosophy and perform this kind of introspection. =D
