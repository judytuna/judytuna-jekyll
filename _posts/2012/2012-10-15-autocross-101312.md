I’ve heard Jeremie talk about autocross a lot, but never got a chance to go until Saturday. I had a BLAST.

I had the privilege of riding in Jeremie’s Z for my first lap ever, which [resulted in a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqEp378U4VM&list=PLts7MF1LVIaNHgtvRWFdAAe3SHTKg1SrL&index=6&feature=plpp_video) I’m slightly embarrassed about. I didn’t sleep the night before and was already in hysterics anyway. haha. And he was doing it on purpose. If you watch the video, you can sort of tell when he spun out. 

Also got to ride in: 

Scott’s Miata

Curtis’ new 2012 Subaru WRX STi [[1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEWUeEBlUKw&list=PLts7MF1LVIaNHgtvRWFdAAe3SHTKg1SrL&index=3&feature=plpp_video), [2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmwjUt-Vb-Y&list=PLts7MF1LVIaNHgtvRWFdAAe3SHTKg1SrL&index=2&feature=plpp_video), 3]

a Lexus

Charles’ Lotus Elise

Rita’s Lotus Exige

I want to get a miata so I can race, too. Also I have to learn to drive stick. I have my motorcycle license, but have still never driven a manual transmission car in my life. haha. 

so much fun.
