      Whoa! Wish I had known, I might have been able to come. I was in Prague yesterday, but now I'm back in Saarbr√ºcken. Have fun!

for the [Wikipedia Hackathon: Berlin 2012](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Berlin_Hackathon_2012)!

I'm going on a sightseeing trip led by a WMF Germany volunteer: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Berlin_Hackathon_2012/Sightseeing/June_1

I am in the lounge area of the hostel for wifi right now, and met a bunch of other people attending the Wikipedia hackathon. One of them was the creator of [the "I'm hacking" badges](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Drecodeam/Berlin_Hackathon_Badge): ![](https://judytuna.com/files/2012/05/Berlin_Hackathon_badge_Hacking_Blue_-300x300.png)
