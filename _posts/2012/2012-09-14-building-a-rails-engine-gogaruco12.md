Building a Rails Engine
0.14
11/11/05 - DHH wrote an anti-engine post on the official RoR blog. Basically writing against how we use Rails today (bringing in Omniauth, etc) -- thought you should build application-specific solutions because it would be so easy. "the goal of rails is to create a world where they are neither needed or strongly desired" -- that's not the world we have to day, so it's an interesting historical note. The goal for rails in 2005 was not to have pluggable components -- it was going to be "if you need something, 10 lines of custom code! it'll be that easy!"
JAmes Adam, "it would be madness to include them in the core rails" -- creator of Engines
So how did we get here?
a rails application is an engine. you cannot build a rails app without an engine

may 21, 08 - merb slices. same idea of engines for merb. "little slices of mvc cake" -- a vertical slicing of an application. slice out a bit of functionality and use them in different applications. how the speaker got invovled -- was using merb, wrote merbadmin (first gogaruco lightning talks on merbadmin). his first open source project. took open source css from django ;-) you see a lot of sharing in the open source community but not a lot across languages.

12/23/08 - rails and merb merge. merb was dead as a standalone project, but many of the ideas of merb, including engine, got built into rails core.

(my computer died!)

I live-tweeted this crap out of this =D 

Lunch announcement: salad, chicken breast sandwich with goat cheese because this would not be san francisco without goat cheese, roasted veggie mix, dessert = chocolate mousse custard. Don't worry, there is plenty of food for everyone, plenty for seconds!
