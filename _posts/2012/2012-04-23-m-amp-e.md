      I get a kick out of how Emma is immune to the enforcement of morays and cultural norms. It's quite ageist. She can spit, climb, scream and steal all the live long day with no intervention from society! I blame the parents. Often they enthusiastically encourage such behavior.

maiki and Emma came to visit a few days ago. Emma is growing up so fast. E smiled at me and tried to take my glasses. Their love is abundant.
