I like Ellie Goulding’s song [Lights](http://youtu.be/0NKUpo_xKyQ), which I found out about through the [Bassnectar remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGlIDlOqurA). It’s my favorite dubstep. 

I just found out that HelloEnjoy created an [interactive music video for Lights](http://lights.elliegoulding.com/) using Three.js and WebGL. They wrote up the technology here: [http://www.netmagazine.com/features/behind-scenes-lights-latest-webgl-sensation](http://www.netmagazine.com/features/behind-scenes-lights-latest-webgl-sensation)

It’s a good read — there are details about how they chose visuals to go along with different sections of the music, how they created the terrain, challenges they ran into and how they solved them. 

We used a tiny bit of Three.js for [MobileGraffiti](mobilegraffiti.com/) at AngelHack =)
