i changed my mind. how about a [sony clie PET-N760C](http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start;sid=Tu4sBjrdb4osBwcnheEmDXXN0EtAs_pL8S8=?CatalogCategoryID=COAKC0%2eN424AAADystDA1ReJ&ProductID=ksAKC0%2eNrPEAAADy8RXA1ReO)... heh heh heh. 

you took the word
and made it heard
and eased the people's pain and for that
you were idolized
immortalized
you were not the same after that
walking tall
you bought it all
you were not the same ater that
till someone died
on the waterslide
you were not the same, the same

you've seen them drop like flies
from the bright sunny skies
they come knockin at the door with this look in their eyes
you got one good trick and you're hangin on you're hangin on 
to it

ooo-ooo-oooooo-ooo
ooo-ooo-ooooooooo-ooo...

(i think i like the piano-only live album versions of most of these songs better than the studio album ones)
