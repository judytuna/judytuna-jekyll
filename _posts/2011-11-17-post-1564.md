According to two blood tests in August & September of this year, I have persistent asymptomatic neutropenia. I have an appointment with a hematologist in January of next year.

I picked up my referral packet today at NEMS. NEMS got me a referral to SF General Hospital (which is where the hematologist is). NEMS is my primary care clinic thingy.

my 1st blood test (in August) says…

number white blood cells: 2.7 x 10^3/uL == 2700

percentage of wbc that are neutrophil: 8%

my 2nd blood test (in September) says…

white blood cells: 2.3 x 10^3 per uL of blood == 2300

percentage of white blood cells that are neutrophils: 12%

So, IF I’m calculating correctly, (yay http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_blood_count )

1. 2700 * 0.08 = 216 neutrophils per microliter of blood

2. 2300 * 0.12 = 276 neutrophils per microliter of blood

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_neutrophil_count and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia say that a count of lower than 500 neutrophils per microliter of blood is, like, rly rly bad. haha. So I guess I will take more tests in January. I hope. I guess I’m kind of scared? I’m reading a lot about white blood cells. The referral letter from NEMS to SF General sounds scary. “28 y/o Chinese female with persistent asymptomatic neutropenia” lol. And the letter that SF General sent in reply to NEMS is even scarier. It asks for a bunch of other tests if they had them (they didn’t cuz I only started going to them this year).
