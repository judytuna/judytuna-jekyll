i repeat myself in this livejournal a lot. i repeat myself in this livejournal a lot. ha, i'm funny.

i have this pile of clothes next to me and joan just pointed at them, perplexed, and said "i thought you just did your laundry yesterday!" and i was ilke "i did, but those are jackets and things that did not need to be washed" 

i want to get like a bunch of hooks and put them on the wall so that i can hang jackets there. but i also want a bookshelf there. maybe i can get a short bookshelf and hang stuff on the wall over that.................................................................................................

thursday: performing with [all real](www.allrealmusic.com) at the theater rice showcase 155 dwinelle. i think the theater rice showcase starts at 7. 

friday: performing with [decadence](decadence.berkeley.edu) at the aba fashion show. then i am performing with angela at the aba fashion show because i said i'd do a "solo" performance and now i got angela to play guitar with me. yay. it will be fun. 
    (we *were* going to sing at the "west coast a cappella showcase" but i guess we're not. because they never got back to us. and plus, we're missing a third of the group friday night anyway.) 

saturday: performing with all real at the theater rice showcase. yeah, the theater rice showcase is thurs, fri and sat, but i'm only going at the thurs and sat ones. 

i just talked to jeyling, who i haven't talked to in a whiiiiile, and she's in ucla's random voices. and random voices will be performingi n the west coast a cappella showcase on *saturday*. i wish i could go watch, but yeah singing w/ all real will be fun. =) 

I HAVE STUFF DUE TOMORROW MORNING AT 9 AM....
