      <p>This color quiz, while accurate in assuming I am stressed, is rather negative about my personality:</p>
      <p>Your Existing Situation<br />
      Physical illness, over-tension, or emotional distress have taken a severe toll. Her self-esteem has been reduced and now needs peaceful conditions and considerate treatment to permit recovery. </p>
      <p>Your Stress Sources<br />
      Unfulfilled hopes have led to uncertainty and apprehension. Needs to feel secure and to avoid any further disappointment, and fears being passed over or losing standings and prestige. Doubts that things will be any better in the future and this negative attitude leads her to make exaggerated demands and to refuse to make reasonable compromises. </p>
      <p>Your Restrained Characteristics<br />
      Willing to participate and to allow herself to become involved, but tries to fend off conflict and disturbance in order to reduce tension.<br />
      Feels cut off and unhappy because of the difficulty in achieving the essential degree of cooperation and harmony which she desires</p>
      <p>Your Desired Objective<br />
      Wants to make a favorable impression and be regarded as a special personality. Is therefore constantly on the watch to see whether on the watch to see whether she is succeeding in this and how others are reacting to her. this makes her feel she is in control. Uses tactics cleverly in order to obtain influence and special recognition. Susceptible to the esthetic or original. </p>
      <p>Your Actual Problem<br />
      Disappointment and the fear that there is no point in formulating fresh goals have led to anxiety. Desires recognition and position, but is worried about her prospects. Reacts to this by protecting at any criticism and resisting any attempt to influence her. Tries to assert herself by meticulous control of detail in an effort to strengthen her position. </p>
      <p>I mean, Jeez, I'm stressed and depressed, but not THAT stressed and depressed.</p>
