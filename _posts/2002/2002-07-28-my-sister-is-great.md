my sister is so smart! she's never learned to ride a bike before... we sent in ray's old yellow bike for a tuneup... today she hopped on it and paddled and waddled a bit... and 10 minutes after she hopped on it she was zooming by our house!!!!! she's off around the block now. YAY ANNIE!! YOU'RE A GENIUS!!!

and now she just stumbled in and announced "i just fell into a thorn bush" ... hehehe =) =)
