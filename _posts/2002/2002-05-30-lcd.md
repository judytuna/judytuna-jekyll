      <p>Your LCD is negative? My whole world view sometimes goes negative. Believe me, that's much worse. Cheers, Jer</p>

my lcd screen just became negative! (i cracked it about a month ago) it's done this before, but it might be permanent this time because it's been like this for a few minutes now. hey! it just became normal again! parts in the middle get greyer and greyer progressively, then it pops back to white... weird!!!! oh well, it still works =)
