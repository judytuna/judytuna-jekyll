okay today was the first SMT meeting--i feel stressed but really excited about the upcoming semester. it's going to be busy, and i'm already overwhelmed by all the meetings i have to plan! ahh!!! meetings upon meetings upon meetings...

i dropped ee42. this means i am officially not pursuing the cs major anymore. frightening. like i've lost a part of my identity or something. but liberating because now i can go pursue other things... i dunno man. a part of me is like scared of my parents and a part is like, JUDY YOU IDIOT WHY SHOULD YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE FOR OTHER PEOPLE? WHAT DO YOU WNAT TO DO? and the thing is, i don't know what i want to do! and i've established that in my last post enough already. 

MUST... FINISH... FIRST TWO ACTS OF HAMLET....
