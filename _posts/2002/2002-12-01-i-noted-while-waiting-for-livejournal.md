i noted, while waiting for livejournal to contact the server or whatever it does, that in my last entry i use erratic spelling, particularly of the word squirrel. is that how you spell squirrel? i use erratic grammar too, but that's nothing unusual.

i didn't know for the longest time that a "squire" was something that followed a knight around. wait, no, that's a page. what's the difference between a page and a squire?

(yes! it IS contacting the server. it just told me "cannot contact server. try again later")
