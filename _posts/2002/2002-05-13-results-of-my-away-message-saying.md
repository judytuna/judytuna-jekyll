results of my away message saying "what's your favorite allergy medicine? allegra isn't doing it for me" for about 12 hours or so...
benadryl: 1 (makes you sleepy tho)
claritin/claritin-D: 2 (and they taste like m&ms)
zyrtec: 2 (it's the best)
wishes he had allergy medicine: 1
allergies suck because her eyeballs itch: 1
switch off btwn allegra/claritin: 1

haha. yup once again my livejournal entry has no brain to it at all. dumping old AIM profile stuff. la la la.
