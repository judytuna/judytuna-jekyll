      <p>AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH i just wrote a long response that got erroneously deleted!  well i was saying that one time i popped corn i think on a skillet thing when i was camping, but that's kind of a fuzzy memory, so i could have made it up.  for sure i once popped corn in sand (like the native americans? did) on an outdoor stove.  and about three days ago i popped corn in the mircowave except i made my own corn packet thing by putting popping corn in a paper lunch bag and adding butter and sticking it in the microwave (it works great!).  so i was thinking if one knew the right ingredients for kettle corn (brown sugar, corn starch, salt..?) one could just stick that in a paper bag with popping corn and pop it.  but i'm open to popping corn in other ways (like on the stove) (fo sheazy).  i have lots and lots of popping corn.</p>

      <p>whoooooooa you are a corn-popping expert! i bow down to your corn-popping greateness! fo shizzle!</p>
      <p>how do you get popping corn? just... buy bags of it? what makes it different from other corn? does it have to be specially treated? if i grew a corn stalk could i get popping corn from the ears?</p>
      <p>i thought that the ingredients for kettle corn were just sugar and salt and butter? and i thought it was plain normal white sugar. but i have no idea. </p>
