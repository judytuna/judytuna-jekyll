Here is a commercial for some Dior fragrance.

1. It was directed by Wong Kar Wai. Who I rather like.

2. It features [Eva Green](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1200692/). Who I rather like.

3. The song is Space Dementia, from Museâ€™s 2nd album. I rather like Muse.

If I cared about perfume, this commercial would have been very effective. Alas for Dior. Thank you, [Kristen](http://lexcorpninja.vox.com/library/post/midnight-poison.html).

Have any of you seen [My Blueberry Nights](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765120/)?
