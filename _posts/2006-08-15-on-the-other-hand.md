and of course, the wikipedia article is WELL WORTH A READ. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi , and here is my favorite part:

Though technically Yoshi's species would be "yoshi," it is unknown whether he is a dragon or a dinosaur. In the English Super Mario Kart instruction manual, Yoshi and Princess Toadstool are referred to as "the lady and the dragon," [5] but this is likely just a reference to damsel in distress and dragon-guarded castle stories. In the Japanese version of Super Mario World, Yoshi refers to himself as "Super Dragon Yoshi" in a letter to Mario. This made its way to Super Mario Advance 2, which uses both the English version's pawprint, and starts to use Yoshi's "Super Dragon Yoshi" after the end of the game. And in the remake of Super Mario 64 for the Nintendo DS called Super Mario 64 DS, Yoshi's special power is to release fire from its mouth [6] like a dragon. In spite of this, Yoshi did originate in Dinosaur Land, and it seems therefore logical to regard him as a dinosaur. The Nintendo 64 game 'Yoshi's Story' refers to the Yoshi hatchlings as dinosaurs as well. Also, Yoshi is labeled a dinosaur in his character description in the original Super Smash Bros.. In the Super Mario World animated TV series, Luigi has called Yoshi a "Yoshisaur" in the episode "Mama Luigi". Like most cartoon shows based on video games, the series is not considered canonical. Recent video games also refer to Yoshi as a dinosaur.
