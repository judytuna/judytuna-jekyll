this song makes me cry

edwin mccain - i'll be
the strands in your eyes taht color them wonderful stop me, steal my breath
and emeralds from mountains thrust towards the sky
never revealing their depth
and TELL MEE that we belong together
dress it up
with the trappings of love
i'll be captivated i'll hang from your lips instead of the gallows
of heartache that hang from above
AND IIII'LLLLL BEEEEE 
YOUR CRYIN SHOULDER
i'll be 
love's suicide
and I'LLLLLLLL BEEEEE better when i'm older
i'll be
the greatest fan of your life

rain falls
angry on the tin roof
as we lie awake in our bed
you're my survival you're my living proof
my love is alive
and not dead

and tell me that we belong together
dress it up with the trappings of love
i'll be captivated i'll hang from your lips instead of the gallows
of heartache
that hang from above

AND I'LLLL BEEEEE
your cryin shoulder
i'll be
love suicide
and I'LLLL BEEEEEE
better when i'm older
i'll be
the greatest fan of your life

and i've dropped out
burned out
found my way back from the dead
tuned in
turned on
remembered the thing that you
you SAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIID:
i'll be your cryin shoulder i'll be love suicide i'll be better when i'm older i'll be 
the greatest
fan of your life
