a lady found joan's cell out on the grass of panoramic hill. THANK GOD. she called the last number dialed on her phone and he called us here, and then we got serena (who got her CA license last week) to drive krista's stick shift car up the hill to retrieve it. i didn't really fear for my life--serena's hella brave. the lady bitched me about about how we should "enjoy the beauty of the area--but please clean up the bottles and cans that you bring" ... i said "i'm sorry about that, i didn't have any bottles" and she looked at me with utter contempt and hate. poor rich old people who live up there and are traumatized by college kids all the time. ugh. 

so anyway it ended well.
