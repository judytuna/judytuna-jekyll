missed a cs proj (confusion about slip days)
still not done with english essay
cs midterm at 5:30 tomorrow... or rather, today
am i performing with deCadence on sproul tomorrow? no, i'm going to go to lecture. but if i'm not there it screws up a bunch of stuff... i feel bad, but i have to go to cs lecture
am i dropping chinese? i have to, it's way too hard, and it's not fulfilling any req's for me or anything anyway
what about english? should i rethink trying to double major?
or should i rethink whatever other major i want to be? math? cs? cogsci? applied math? what? what? what?
it's so late, WHY AM I NOT ASLEEP
