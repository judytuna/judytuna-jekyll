she's taking her time
making up the reasons
to justify all the hurt inside
i guess she knows
from the smiles and the look in their eyes
everyone's got a theory bout the bitter one
they're sayin
mama never loved her much, and
daddy never keeps in touch
that's why she shies away from human affection
but
somewhere in a private place
she packs her bags for outer space
and now she's waitin for the right kind of pilot to come
and she'll say to him
she's sayin

i will fly you to the moon and back
if you'll be
if you'll be my baby
got a ticket for a world where we belong
so won't you be my baby yeah

she can't remember a time
when she felt needed
if love was red then she was colorblind
all her friends, well they've been trialed for treason
in crimes that were never defined
she's sayin
love is like a barren place
and reachin out for human faith is,
is like a journey i just don't have a map for, so
baby gonna take a dive 
and i'm pushin it to overdrive
and send a signal that she's hangin all her hopes on the stars
what a pleasant dream
she's singin

i will fly you to the moon and back...
hold on
hold on
