Peeing
    Water is wide, and
The river will run smoothly;
         Nature calls me now.

Hs1ao (2:42:53 PM): but we wont get into that
juddie t u n a (2:43:05 PM): HAHAHAHAHA
juddie t u n a (2:43:07 PM): when we're inthe mood
juddie t u n a (2:43:11 PM): inspiration will strike
...
Hs1ao (2:45:28 PM): the weird thing is that its actually pretty beautiful sounding
