hellotoast is funny. 

hellotoast (5:16:24 AM): there’s a point of diminishing marginal utility

juddietuna (5:16:32 AM): hahahaha

juddietuna (5:17:02 AM): wait a moment as a parse “diminishing marginal utility”

juddietuna (5:17:08 AM): i think the longest repeated substring is “in”

hellotoast (5:17:16 AM): hahahaha

hellotoast (5:17:18 AM): omg don’t do that

juddietuna (5:17:24 AM): “do”

hellotoast (5:17:24 AM): omg

juddietuna (5:17:27 AM): “”

hellotoast (5:17:29 AM): now i’m doing it everywhere!

hellotoast (5:17:37 AM): noooo!

juddietuna (5:17:40 AM): “ooo”

juddietuna (5:17:48 AM): BWAHAHAHAHAA

hellotoast (5:17:48 AM): alk;je4oibjliaejrlaksjlkvnalkejrlkesjriae

juddietuna (5:17:51 AM): uh

hellotoast (5:17:52 AM): =P

juddietuna (5:17:56 AM): i don’t feel like it anymore

juddietuna (5:18:00 AM): Segmentation Fault

hellotoast (5:18:04 AM): hahaha

hellotoast (5:18:09 AM): that’s not going to fly with the autograder judy

juddietuna (5:18:20 AM): hahhahaa

juddietuna (5:18:29 AM): rm -rf autograder

juddietuna (5:18:36 AM): take THAT!

hellotoast (5:18:37 AM): hahahahahaha

hellotoast (5:18:40 AM): hahahaha

juddietuna (5:18:45 AM): I WIN!!!

hellotoast (5:18:53 AM): sock it to ’em judy!

hellotoast (5:27:48 AM): crap judy i just found a bug in my 170 program

juddietuna (5:27:55 AM): OH NO

hellotoast (5:27:59 AM): which you inadvertently pointed out to me

juddietuna (5:28:06 AM): ??!??

hellotoast (5:28:11 AM): when i said “omg”

hellotoast (5:28:13 AM): you said “”

hellotoast (5:28:27 AM): and i realized that my program doesn’t work when there’s no substring!

hellotoast (5:40:24 AM): this assignment was crazy

hellotoast (5:40:29 AM): i was very enthralled by it

juddietuna (5:40:30 AM): it’s fun though

hellotoast (5:40:36 AM): i couldn’t stop thinking about it

juddietuna (5:40:48 AM): write it a sonnet

hellotoast (5:41:03 AM): hahaha

hellotoast (5:41:29 AM): do you think anyone has ever written a serious sonnett about computer science?

hellotoast (5:41:43 AM): i don’t think it’s psychologically possible 

i love cs!

Sir Dobel (5:56:27 AM): I’m reading a paper which gives a mathematical analysis of the rubik’s cube using group theory!

Sir Dobel (5:56:55 AM): earlier I was starting to program my 4d rubik’s cube program….but I started getting a little confused

juddietuna (5:57:03 AM): 4d?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!

juddietuna (5:57:07 AM): how does that even work?!?!?!?!

Sir Dobel (5:57:56 AM): about exactly how to represent the 4-dimensions…..I *think* it’s representable by 4 3-d cubes…the only problem being that you have to be able to see the inner cubits as well as the outer ones….because just as the “inside” of 2d objects are on the surface of 3d objects, so are the “insides” of 3d objects on the surface of 4d objects

juddietuna (5:58:12 AM): oh my god

Sir Dobel (5:58:37 AM): the problem is you can’t really use your geometric intuition…so I need to develop a purely formal representation for 3d rubik’s cube, and then I think it will be clear how to extend that to the 4th dimension
