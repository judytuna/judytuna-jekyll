A sampling of conversation over the weekend:
Ryan: I love my parrot.
Judy: I'm going to go to [Elwynn Forest](http://www.blizzard.com/wow/townhall/elwynn.shtml) and buy a kitty! You know, I haven't seen any kittens around... I've seen parrots, and a gnome with an adorable bunny, but no kittens. Maybe Elwynn Forest is just farther away from areas I've visited in the last day or so...
Ryan: Maybe.
Judy: Oh no! I can't get a kitty, she'll eat your parrot!
Ryan: Cats don't really eat parrots. I mean, senegal parrots are pretty big. A cat wouldn't eat... an eagle. A parakeet, well, parakeets are really small.
