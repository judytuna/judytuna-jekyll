MUSE PERFORMING FEELIN’ GOOD HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKHEhPyyAlo HAHAHAHAHA

I never watched this video because it was labelled “wat happens wen they’re drunk” and I thought it would be some dumb 3-second snippet of them walking onto the set of something. But it’s them doing feelin’ good. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 

I don’t know if he was drunk or just feeling crazy that day.

I vote that we do it like them. HAHAHHA

edited to add: here is the new bside from the starlight single, which came out yesterday in the UK. it is called Easily http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kU-d5vdrn2E
