this is hilarious. this is astounding. this is pathetic. this is the concept of ddr... but applied to piano. i cannot believe it. i cannot believe that someone came up with this idea in the first place, got a company to make the machine for it, got people to program songs into it. and i cannot believe that someone is a virtuouso at this thing. i am in awe. i am in shock. i am in shock and awe. is this something to applaud, a talent, an ability to wire the brain in any way imaginable? or is it something to deplore, evidence of the utter and total commercialization of everything, even... classical piano?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!

only time will tell. time, the great arbiter, the monumental force pushing us through the centures, through the baroque, classical, romantic and contemporary eras, the drift and pull of the ages producing ever greater and lesser works of art. is this it, then? the culmination of the millennia? an arcade game?
