If we get 30 people to take this lame survey, we get $60!!! But they have to be 30 "qualified responses," which means that: 
Q3 – Must play with PC as the primary gaming platform (as opposed to console) 

  Q4 – Must play online games

  Q7 – Must play MMORPG games (amongst others) 

  Q10 – Cannot have a family member working in related industries

And then you write that your home game center is: Eudemonia, Berkeley, CA.
