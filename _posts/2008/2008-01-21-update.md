HA HA I JUST GOT MY MELODY ASSISTANT CODE BACK! NOW I CAN ACTUALLY ARRANGE IT! AND ALSO FINISH (REDO?) VIENNA TENG'S "HARBOR" ! IT WAS SO EASY! I HAD LOST THE EMAIL FROM 2003 WITH MY MELODY ASSISTANT CODE IN IT AND JUST LOOKED AT THE WEBSITE http://www.myriad-online.com/en/products/melody.htm AND THERE'S A "RETRIEVE YOUR CODE" BUTTON AND IT WORKED INSTANTLY WOOO!

Maybe I should stop eating this peppermint bark from crate & barrel. Maybe it is the sugar. But I miss Nick. =( =(
