      <p>The one summer I spent in the Mission was more than enough for me.  I mean, I was at Church &amp; 16th and that was fucking enough.  Blech.</p>

so you say you think you are lonely
or for you the sun don't shine
then let me take you by the hand
and take you through the streets of london
i'll show you something
that'll make you change your mind.

san francisco is fucking smelly. well, mission street is. how did i not know this previous to this morning? answer: usually if going to 24th street bart, i get off the bus and straight into the bart station. this morning i missed the 24th street stop and had to walk a whole two blocks (oh the pain, the agony) holding my breath (oh god why is life so hard).
