i’m in a much better mood now because a kid walked up to me and said “judy are you good at math? cuz ory says to walk up to any asian and they’ll know math”

he asked for help with two math problems. he’s gonna be taking an entrance exam for community college later this week, so i showed him how to figure it out, and he asked what the underlying concept was, and i was able to come up with something, and give a generic example. he was very grateful and said “you can tell after just one experience if someone is a good math teacher. some people are impatient, or don’t want to teach, or can’t identify or express the concept you’re supposed to walk away with.” so that made me feel really good. so will chang is right. i should go teach. i should teach math to 7th graders. just not in oakland. shit.
