Dude. It's not just WAR: my computer plays even MP3s in skips and jumps. There must be something wrong with... the operating system, or the memory, or SOMEthing. I have two hard drives, and they're both partitioned into two partitions each. One hard drive has a 10gig partition with my operating system. Maybe that's not enough or something? Where is my page file? I dunno?
