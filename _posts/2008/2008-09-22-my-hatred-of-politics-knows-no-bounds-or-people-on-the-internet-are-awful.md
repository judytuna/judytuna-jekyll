Stardock has a game called "The Political Machine." There’s a free version focusing on McCain and Obama.

Browse the forums for a few seconds and you will find everybody lambasting the liberal bleeding hearts for making noise about Guantanamo Bay prisoners. You will also find racism and misogyny, as well as conservatives saying that liberals are racist and misogynist.

In this thread, Obama is called "the Obamanible Blackman" http://politicalmachine.com/article/325215/Please_List_Obamas_Accomplishments/page/1 Later in the thread, someone talks about how she thinks black people (who are named LaShawn and Shaniqua, no less) "piss away" taxpayer money.

In this thread, you can see "Obama bin Laden" http://politicalmachine.com/article/318496/Big_win_For_Bush 

There are also threads thanking our president because clearly he is the one resonsible for the fact that our country hasn’t been invaded in the last 7 years. There are also threads about how Obama has no qualifications, while Palin has lists and lists of them. Also, people say things like "what, her beauty is making you shy? ;-)" completely sincerely.

Really? "The Obamanible Blackman" ?

I have to live in the same country as these people?

Whatever. I hate it all.
