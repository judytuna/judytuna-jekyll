      <p>hi connie! =D</p>
      <p>i'm not singing with him, no. i think he has new material in the works, though, and as far as i can tell he's still performing as magnetic north and solo-ly. i actually haven't spoken with him much either, or seen him for months... i miss that kid; he was fun to live with.</p>
      <p>so... where are you? how's life? i feel like we have this bit of livejournal commenting a few times a year, haha. anything to not lose contact! i like the picture of us on miriam's facebook. haha.</p>
      <p>i'm still in berkeley.</p>

RENT is winding down, so they had a competition for a fan video tribute. Derek won. Yes. My old roommate. I used to live with this guy. FUCKING LEET I'M TELLING YOU. He won a chance to meet the cast/RENT team and maybe go to the final Broadway performance, but he already has a gig on that night. But still. Congratulate him and, in his own words, his newfound "lowered street credibility.  Hah!  Who cares about that anyways =P."

HERE IS THE VIDEO:

INCREDIBLE.

==== LYRICS ====
i was a college kid
never quite positive
what to study i slacked off
often got lost admist

i botched flunked all my tests
i lost my scholarships
but truthfully i couldn't care less
about a degree or doctorate

instead it was the opposite
music and song lyrics
were the things that captured me
but i lacked the courage and confidence

to be honest with
me and follow this
dream until i found the strength
the day i saw RENT

and heard the guitar picks
and became witness to roger hit
those glory notes in one song
blown away in awe i flipped

like he was reading my consciousness
singing my life synopsis
and with every single syllable
he made everything all make sense

so soon as i left the box office
each minute's been god's gift
cuz no day but today
has been my favorite motto since

living the life i ought to live
having a dream and following it
i'm so thankful to you RENT
that before you left you taught me this

and if i need solace again
the cast of RENT will always lend
life support to me whenever
i grab the cd and pop it in

forever i'll call on them
forever i'll call them friends
cuz i owe them my life
so forever i'll honor RENT

i'll honor RENT

all the way until the end i'll honor rent
every day with every breath i'll honor rent

every message every theme i'll honor them
all the precious memories i'll honor them

all the crew band and staff i'll honor them
the producers and the cast i'll honor them

every season upon us i'll honor rent
jonathan larson a god send i honor him
