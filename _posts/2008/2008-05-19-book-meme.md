      <p>Only the ones I've read, for brevity (bolding omitted):<br />
      ------------------------------------<br />
      * The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay<br />
      * Brave New World<br />
      <u>The Canterbury Tales</u><br />
      * The Catcher in the Rye<br />
      * Catch-22<br />
      <i>^ Cryptonomicon</i> -- I like his other books.  Shallow, but fun, good summer reading.  This book sucks.  To make matters worse, everyone assumes I must like it because I'm a mathematician.<br />
      ^ David Copperfield<br />
      * Dubliners<br />
      <i>^ Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves</i> -- Aside: Lynne Truss is a blight upon society and a shining example of England's continued butchery of the English language.  I counted 3 grammatical errors on a single 2-page spread from this supposed treatise on grammar.  Anyone who believes that having this book on their shelf "makes them look smart" shouldn't have dropped out of high school before passing 10th grade English.  See also the New Yorker's excellent, scathing review of this book.<br />
      Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything<br />
      Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies<br />
      A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius<br />
      * The Hobbit<br />
      The Iliad<br />
      <u>The Inferno</u><br />
      Life of Pi -- Again, this makes you look smart?  What the hell?  A mediocre piece of pulp fiction, popular only because Americans can't decide how they want to feel about religion.<br />
      * Lolita<br />
      * Love in the Time of Cholera<br />
      Middlesex<br />
      <u>The Odyssey</u><br />
      On the Road<br />
      <u>* A People’s History of the United States: 1492-Present</u> -- My (marxist) US History teacher made us read this.  I am forever grateful.<br />
      <u>* A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</u> -- The most influential book of my adolescence.<br />
      The Prince<br />
      The Satanic Verses<br />
      * Slaughterhouse-five<br />
      <u>A Tale of Two Cities</u><br />
      * Ulysses<br />
      <u>****** The Unbearable Lightness of Being</u> -- Best novel yet written.  Period.  I honestly can't conceive of a universe in which a better novel exists.<br />
      <i>^ Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> -- A girlfriend made me read this book because she thought it was great.  I broke up with her because of it.</p>

      <p>Wow Steve, I agree with you 600% on Life of Pi and Zen... Those two books in particular are doubly irritating because of the sheer number of people who are taken aback when you voice your opinion that they suck. What is it about these books that strikes a chord in everyone but us? Zen was worse for me because of the higher level of pretension. What a pathetic piece of pseudo-philosophical putrescence. </p>
      <p>Based on our haterade correlation, I'm putting "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" on my must-read list.</p>

      <p>what, no greek mythology, and no A Brief History of Time?<br />
      Also, I feel dumb for only reading like 15 of these books.  Tangentially, do you know what I'm reading right now?  Protools: 210m Music Production Techniques.  Uuugh.</p>

      <p>I think the premise of the meme is flawed.  These books are marked as unread but it does not necessarily follow that they are kept on the shelf to make one appear smart.  Perhaps they were simply recommended.  Or they are part of a cultural cannon despite their lack of quality.  I, for one, cannot wrap my head around the fact that so many people want to read Anansi Boys.</p>

      <p>I thought the same thing about Anansi boys. Even Neverwhere is, in my opinion, too predictable to really be a classic... </p>

      <p>Right now I'm re-reading Stranger in a Strange Land. I last read it in HS, and I remembered Heinlein being a little obsessed with the orgies, but this time what's creeping me out is how incredibly sexist he makes his male characters. I mean I know Jubal Harshaw is supposed to be that kinda dude and all, but does he have to pat them on the ass and ask "go get me a drink that's a good girl?" Bleh. </p>
