They did not have a soundalike contest this year. So last year, I missed my chance to sing Lament of the Highborne in front of thousands of people for eternal internet fame. If only I had prepared for it last year. I would have won. I would have become the fantasy of every partly-lesbian Sylvanas fan in the whole Blizzard fandom for a week. Seriously, this year at the Sound and Music panel, a girl got up and said "thank you for composing Lament of the Highborne. It's the most beautiful piece of music I've ever heard in my life and it means so much to me" while crying. If I sang it at the contest, I could have had accolades beyond my wildest dreams. If only.
