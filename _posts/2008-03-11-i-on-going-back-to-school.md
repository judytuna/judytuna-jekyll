Ramon: well

 me: okay

**II. I Read The Asthmatic Kitty Newsletter And Find Out About A New Game**
Download the demo: http://www.audio-surf.com/  -- top played song is "still alive." hahaha.
This marks my first foray into using Steam personally.

Asthmatic Kitty Records put together a compilation of songs to play with this game. They say "The end result is a driving, definitive, compilation comprised of previously released and some unreleased material that is cohesive if only because our criteria was playability in addition to quality. Apparently, there is a mathematical and musical beauty in that." Hahahhaha. Hahahahaha. Of course I would be drawn to this; my love/hate of pretentious indie music and "pretentious" "math" is well-documented. http://asthmatickitty.com/music.php?releaseID=95

**V. In Jenny's Immortal Words: "He's So Dreamy"**
We saw Sweeney Todd yesterday. At the metreon, the only place left still playing it. It was incongruously beautiful outside. Afterwards, she went around singing "i will have venngeeaannncee" and i went around singing "i feeeeeeeeeeel youuuuu joohaaaaaannnaaaaaa" and then we did not buy pastries, and then we did buy pastries. I just looked all over for an image of Mr. Depp in suspenders in the window, but couldn't find one. I guess it'll have to wait until the dvd comes out and people make screencaps. For now, [emoooo](http://www.allmoviephoto.com/photo/2007_sweeney_todd_039.html).

So yeah. I'd never seen it before on stage or video or anything, and had never sat down to listen to any of the songs. But of course I recognized "how is it you sing" from sundry voice recitals in my distant past. And so on.

**VI. It's Been A While Since I Thought About The X-Files**

One day, you'll ask me to speak of the truth, of the miracle of your birth, to explain what is unexplained. And if I falter or fail on this day, know there is an answer, my child. A sacred, imperishable truth, but one you may never hope to find alone. Chance meeting your perfect other, your perfect opposite, your protector and endangerer. Chance embarking with this other on the greatest of journeys, a search for truths fugitive and imponderable. If one day this chance may befall you, my son, do not fail or falter to seize it. The truths are out there. And if one day you should behold a miracle as I have in you, you will learn the truth is not bound in science, or on some unseen plain, but by looking into your own heart. And in that moment you will be blessed and striken. For the truest truths are what hold us together, or keep us painfully, desperately apart.
