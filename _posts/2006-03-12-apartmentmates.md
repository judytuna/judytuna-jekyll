My new apartmentmate is named Alex. He draws good. http://www.wanderingpanda.com/

Derek and Theresa's album is coming out on March 21. It's a real CD. Even more real than DeCadence's second CD. http://www.magnetichiphop.com/products.html
You should really check it out. If knowing that Magnetic North is awesome isn't enough for you, well, VIENNA TENG sings on one of their tracks.

Real album, you guys. Be the first on your block to get it.
