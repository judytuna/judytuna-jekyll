Among the things blood elf males say is "don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?"
Among the things blood elf females say are "I'm the girl the ESRB warned you about," "My mana tap brings all the boys to the yard," and "No. No. I won't do that. But my sister will."
Draeneis have accents HAHAHAHAHAA
Draenei females keep talking about mating rituals involving the beating of gnomes. Also, "Do gnomes have a vibrate setting? I'm just curious," and "Yes, they're real. Also, they can cut glass!"
Draenei males say things like "What do you mean, I have an octopus on my face?"
