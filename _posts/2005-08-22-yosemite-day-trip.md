i am a flickr addict. here are 42 yosemite pictures. later i will add a few more from my sister’s camera that i took after i ran out of space. although there is nothing here any of you have not seen before and better, photos are still fun. yes, we left at 5:45am this morning (twas still dark!) and got back home at 11:30pm. anyone else up for a day-trip to yosemite anytime soon? cuz i want to go back all the time.

very rough sketch of what we did:
10am: got into park via 120. first stop: bridalveil falls
11am: left car in day-park lot, looked around lodge store, got on bus
12 or so: walked around lower yosemite falls. got [this fantastic shot of a butterfly](http://www.flickr.com/photos/judytuna/36120549/in/set-798777/).
1pm: ate at cafeteria at the lodge
2pm: got on bus, looked around at curry village to check out prices of bikes (7.50/hr) and rafts (13.50/adult); got on bus again, got off at happy isles
3:30pm: decided not to hike up vernal falls. drove up to glacier point instead
5pm: got up to glacier point. man… i love that view. ate a popsicle.
6:15pm: while leaving park, spent a few minutes looking for and very excitedly pointing out to others the locations of mountain climbers 2/3s the way up El Capitan. they are crazies. left via 140.
8pm: after driving out of the mountains, ate at burger king in men… mar… m something-that-is-not-merced. mariposa?
sometime later: went south on 99 instead of north at merced… went past “chowchilla” … laughed at name of town… went back west on 152 and through los banos… through gilroy where we smelled garlic… got home at 11:30.

what i wish to do next time: hike. i think top of vernal falls could easily be done along with other stuff in a day trip. at some point i’d be interested in a half-dome expedition (i’d have to like, train for it hahaha), but that would require staying there at least one night. or a driver who didn’t hike it. haha.
