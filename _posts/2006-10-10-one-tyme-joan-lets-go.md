one tyme = joan. let's go. my plan was to find out what bus goes across the bay at night and write it down here, but transit.511.org isn't working for me (neither is google calendar, so i think it's my connection more than the individual sites) and i've been struggling with it for half an hour (loading... loading... blank page) so i guess i'll just look it up later. but still. let's go.
