christopher robin and i walked along
as the branches stood out (up?) by the moon 
posing our questions ? ? ? ? ? [sounds like "without an eeyore" but that doesn't make sense]
as our days disappeared all too soon.

but i wandered much further today than i should
and i can't seem to find my way back to the woods!

so help me if you can i've got to get 
back to the house at pooh corner by one
you'd be surprised, there's so much to be done!
count all the bees in the hive
chase all the clouds from the sky 
back to the days of christopher robin and pooh

winnie the pooh doesn't know what to do 
got a honey jar stuck on his nose 
he came to me asking help and advice 
and from here no one knows where he goes

so i sent him to ask of the owl, if he's there,
how to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear

so help me if you can i've got to get 
back to the house at pooh corner by one
you'd be surprised, there's so much to be done!
count all the bees in the hive
chase all the clouds from the skyyyy!
back to the days of christopher robin and pooh

lalalalalala... [half of a verse]

back to the days of christopher robin
back to the ways of christopher robin
back to the ways of pooh.

[ends w/ cool chord progression]
