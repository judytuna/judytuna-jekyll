doing way too much at once: learning how to get around on my mac in the first place, figuring out wtf growl is, throwing myself at this [ruby on rails tutorial](http://www.railstutorial.org), learning markdown for funsies, testing code (i have never written tests for code, ever), and downloading 100 billion little nifty things. currently i have this cool autotest thing running and growl makes a little popup with instant results, which is really awesome, but it's really hard to keep track of everything. 

i'm not learning things so much as learning that things are possible, and learning how to look them up in this pdf tutorial. haha.

i downloaded eclipse because my dad told me to. and i think i got the android sdk installed, but i haven't poked it yet. hello http://code.google.com/p/learn-navi/ !
