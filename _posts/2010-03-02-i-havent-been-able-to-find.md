I haven't been able to find my bart EZRider card since I last used it on Saturday, so I just ordered a new one. $5 replacement fee. I checked the log and it hasn't been used since then, at least. Now that I've put the order through, I'll probably find it on the floor where it fell out of my pocket. Expect an update when I do.
