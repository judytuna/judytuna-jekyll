*I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry I masturbated on your Ikea catalog.*

What choice have I but to throw all the blustery praise I can muster at once upon this new find? Gorgeous piano with what appear to be Craigslist ads, verbatim, hilariously sung in almost faux-operatic. It's amazing. With all the truest emotion at finding half a box of condoms and remembering the optimism you had on the day you bought 12. How can I help but be a fan? It's everything I love: the mundane, the profane, with beautiful pretensions towards classical piano (found via a reference to the “wacky two-minute neo-romantic piano cadenza” [not played by sufjan stevens](http://allgoodnaysayers.net/news/2009/03/12/gabriel-kahane-on-you-are-the-blood/#cut-1)). VII is ridiculous and I love it when people very seriously make fun of themselves.

I love it, I love it, I love it.

!!!! Coming to San Francisco April 20. Cafe du Nord. Link has a smattering of critical praise: http://thefamilyrecords.com/gabriel-kahane-goes-on-tour/
