      <p>Clever way for the author to have his character express displeasure with the word without offending anyone that uses it every day! Also clever self-awareness that complaining about being annoyed by "tweeting" is not that important! Besides everybody knows that T-Rex is the main character and we all sympathize with him! Amirite?</p>
