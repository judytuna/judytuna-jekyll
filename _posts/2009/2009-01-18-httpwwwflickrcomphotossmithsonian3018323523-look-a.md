Look at the dresses. Sleeves and corsets, look at those waists, look at the billowing shoulders, look at the flowing skirts. How on earth is that practical? How long did it take to dress just to step outside? Dressing like that makes everything an occasion, even taking a turn about the block. What if you got paint on your dress?
