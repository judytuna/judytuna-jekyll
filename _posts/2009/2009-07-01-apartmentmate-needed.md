If you know anyone looking for a room in san francisco:

$725/mo. Mission at Highland. Parking space included if needed (it's a garage shared with our upstairs neighbors). Our kitchen has a dishwasher and nice range/oven/etc, the common space is spacious and sunny and great for having some people over once in a while (not huge parties, since 2/3s of us are getting busy with school). We're 26, 24, and 22 years old. Need someone to move in ASAP, even if it's just for a little while.
