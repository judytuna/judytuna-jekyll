      <p>Actually I failed at finishing the post. Duuuurrrrrrrrr why did I hit "post" instead of just saving a draft duuurrrr?????? Lots of pictures. I wanted to organize them and showcase the best of them in my post, but there's always http://www.flickr.com/photos/judytuna which has too many to look at because I can't pare anything down QQQQQQ</p>

Posting to Facebook and Flickr isn't enough. I've got to post them here too.
