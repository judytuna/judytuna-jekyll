I liked Avatar so much. Please see it, and then talk to me about it. I didn't want it to end. This was completely inevitable since I am already happiest spending time as my avatar running around in a fantasy world with glowing mushroom jungles and flying mountains with gorgeous waterfalls coming off riding dragonhawks and hunting things. And I hate real life. 

Let's learn to speak Na'vi. http://www.learnnavi.org/navi-vocabulary/ I named my ipod "hi'i eltu", which to the best of my knowledge is how you say "little brain". I have big plans, the first of which is to translate "keep breathing" into Na'vi. Because of the face masks. http://james-camerons-avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Exopack
