      <p>Also:  omg the ARKive footage of them "eating" the dead bird.  Didn't it just look like they were feeling it or something?</p>

Holy Progenitor Of Zeus. This animal can climb trees and break open a coconut. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_crab
I like how he has to rub his legs over his breathing apparatus to keep it moist. That's just gross.
Look at these videos. http://www.arkive.org/coconut-crab/birgus-latro/videos.html I feel my doom stumbling in my general direction, slowly, inexorably, herald of horror all leathery knuckles and pumping arms before my skin is shredded into deliberate mouthfuls and I am delicately, peacefully consumed.

Edited to add: 

He went on to give us *giant, marvelous crabs*.
