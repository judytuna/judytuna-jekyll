Look at this commercial Fritz was in: http://www.poptent.net/media/13580
It's pretty great.

He met Fenny (director/editor/camera) and Jay (voiceover awesome man) at the 2-week-turnaround thingy that I ended up not being a part of at all. They did this 2nd project cuz Fenny found this commercial contest old spice is running. If they win, they get money and fame and stuff. Wish them luck!
