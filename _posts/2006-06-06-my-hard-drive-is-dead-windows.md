My hard drive is dead: windows can't boot. It died last April, too--right before the 1-year warranty was about to wear out, so I sent it in and got a new one (of the same model). Western Digital. Lifetime of about a year.

The problem began yesterday with the wireless keyboard spontaneously quitting on me in Nef's room. Naturally, I thought it was a problem with the keyboard. Batteries purloined from Derek, a couple of restarts, and an old wired keyboard of Derek's later, I got:
"Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:
C:WINDOWSSYSTEM32CONFIGSYSTEM

You can attempt to repair this file by starting Windows Setup using the original Setup CD-ROM.
Select 'r' at the first screen to start repair."

The setup CD (again Derek's) doesn't show any repair options when I examine the hard drive. The repair console (which is what you get when you press 'r') is really a console and as such is intimidating; I followed some directions from sites such as http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/XPrepairinstall.htm#warning2 (thank you Google, thank you Ryan's powerbook, and thank you Ryan) and nothing worked, not even changing the attributes of boot.ini, deleting it, and manually copying over some files from the setup CD to the windows system folder. Soooo... I'm in the market for a new hard drive. Any tips?
