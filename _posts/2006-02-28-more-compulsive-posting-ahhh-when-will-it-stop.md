Move over, defenestrate: coruscate is my new favorite word.

Especially as an admonishment. "Now, coruscate! CORUSCATE I SAY! ARE YOU CORUSCATING YET????!" 

I should have taken Latin. I should have taken a lot of things. Is there a major were I can just read all kinds of shit but not have to try to come up with original arguments or write shit? Yeah, I didn't think so. I love reading, I love it so much, I love learning random things about everything under the sun, I just have no original thoughts of my own. I could listen to people talk about shit forever, heck I could talk about shit forever, I just can't START WRITING GODDAMN MOTHERFUCKING ESSAYS
