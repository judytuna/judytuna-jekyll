My fingernails are too long. My toenails are unacceptably too long. My hair is too long. I want bangs again, but I'm afraid to go get a haircut because I'm afraid it'll go wrong. My grown-out bangs are irritating my eyes.

I'm not really sure what direction to take for acquiring sponsorships for either my LoL podcast, or my Starcraft 2 events. Who should I call? Who should I work with? What kinds of things should I ask for? How can I market my events to make them look appealing to potential sponsors? 

What do I need to do for myself to be more "professional" ? 

This internship at Riot Games is basically my dream job. But I can't finish my resume because I can't sit down and work. I have some bullet points but I think it's horrible. I want the job so much that I can't apply for it because of how sad I will be when I don't get it because I don't have a college degree. 

And I can't apply for it because it's in LA. I just signed a lease on a new place here. I don't want Fritz to have another 3-year girlfriend that leaves for a job (Yvonne graduated from Berkeley and moved home to Las Vegas to make a lot of money). But I want this job so much, and I know two (well, one and a half) people that already work at Riot (paul from newman, and chi's friend david aka phreak), and it's a Community position, something that I already do at eudemonia but doing somewhere else would legitimize it so much, and it's something that I do really want to do as a job, and something that I know I'm good at, or could be good at, given proper training and resources. 

I've been really networking hardcore, accidentally, in the local bay area starcraft community. Pro gamers and casters want to talk to me because they want to be featured at my events. This is great because it's mutually beneficial. I just don 'tknow what to do with it or how to actually turn this into a legitimate career. It's stressing me out.

Here's a link to this short story from Brief Interviews with Hideous Men called "[The Depressed Person](http://www.google.com/search?q=the+depressed+person+short+story)". It's the first link (the pdf). The most important person in my life for five years didn't believe in depression. He had me read this story, so he could say to me, "see? Isn't it pathetic? That's what you sound like. So stop it. There, you'll go to class now!" It didn't help and it still doesn't. 

Managing depression is strange. If you're outside watching, you have to be able to understand that it's pathetic, that the affected person knows it's pathetic and hates herself for it, and persuade the person to help herself despite that. Shock therapy doesn't work, or she would have shocked herself out of it long ago. 

And if you're depressed, yeah, that's what it's like. I know I'm constantly whining. I feel bad about it. I know I'm selfish and self-absorbed and only care about myself and that I see everything through this plastic bubble wrap, where things can't really touch me, and I'm alone, but this is stupid because I'm not alone and people love me and they're great, but I can't see it, or I won't see it, and it's stupid. I know there are many people out there who have it worse than me, much worse, and that all my problems are first-world problems. And I don't want to do anything about it, or talk to anyone, or go anywhere because it's so cold outside and inside my house, no matter how many layers I put on, and the more layers I put on the less inclined to move I am because it limits my range of motion, and I might snap my neck by getting my scarf tangled in something. My stomach feels sour all the time and I never have an appetite and the inside of my mouth is always raw and my tongue keeps getting cut by the edge of my molars, and the edge of my permanent retainer, and my jaw is always sore from clenching it because I'm anxious all the time. And my voice is run ragged, even though I haven't been yelling in the last several days, I swear.

I have too much shit and Fritz gives me shit for not throwing shit away aggressively enough, and so I finally started a Purgatory pile in the kitchen, to start, (not even for my own stuff or clothes), and everybody teases me about some TV show I've never heard of where "specialists" go to packrats' houses bla bla bla and I would consider that such a breach of privacy if someone outside came to my house and told me to throw away this report i have from kindergarten. Fuck you, don't make me throw away this report from kindergarten that says I was smart cognitively for my age but talked under my age. It's worth something to me because it's funny to see that this has been true my entire life. 

Anyway so I started a Purgatory pile and Fritz took one look at it and said "oh, do we really want to throw away this oven mitt?" It has burns and is thin and gross and we live 2 minutes walking distance from a Ross and the house already has others that are prettier and newer and HE YELLS AT ME ALL THE TIME FOR NOT THROWING THINGS AWAY AGGRESSIVELY ENOUGH ADN THEN HE SAYS THIS HIMSELF. I thought he would be proud of me for trying to throw something away but instead he's just a hypocrite. Allt his shows is that it's really stressing me out to have everybody pressure me to get rid of all my shit all the time. I really don't appreciate it. 

I don't have space for it, so I know it's true, and for my own good, and I hate that, and I hate everyone for giving me shit. There's a charity pickup on the 11th and I'm going to try to give away old clothes, but I'd have to sort through them first, and as soon as I do that, I can put actual clothes in the closet, and as soon as I do that, then there will be space in our room to take a step (there isn't right now, it is jam-packed full of Things and boxes and Fritz's wooden sword, and HE tells me HE doesn't like ME having TOO MUCH USELESS SHIT) (You know what happens when I get mad about him being mad at me for having shit? He gets huffy and says "well I'm glad you're mad because nothing ever gets done if your'e not mad. At least if you're mad, you're going to do work" and this makes me extremely angry because I am the only one that ever took out the trash, did any dishes, cleaned the bathroom, vacuumed, AUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

The thing to do is a chore wheel. I will always keep a log of every little stupid chore that I fucking do for the house so that they can't say that I "never do shit" GOD DAMN IT. 

The new house is really nice and Javan is very committed to FINISHING things. He wants to put a deadline of 2 weeks for getting all my shit out of the garage. Which is good, and realistic, but it still stresses me out despite myself, and I think he can figure that out and is willing to work with me, but it's really crushing when Fritz says to me "it's jsut that when we do projects, it always seems like your'e not on my team" and the reason I'm not "on his team" is that I'm trying to protect myself from him THROWING ALL MY SHIT AWAY, like this box of spices that I PAID MONEY FOR. Sure, I'm a spoiled bitch and it was my parents' money, not mine, but still. 

And I can't play Limbo on MY xbox (that my parents bought me) because they're always playing the racing game, and I can't show that I'm playing Limbo, because then they'll just be mad at me for not going through my shit and sorting it so that the garage can be clean again.

And the internet fucking sucks. Our other housemate Quentin is really adamant about having our internet go from the cable modem to his linux box to the router, with the linux box acting as a file server for us + acting as a firewall etc + allowing access to our files (with appropriate, secure logins) while we're outside the network, but it's also a piece of shit that doesn't automatically load itself up when the internet comes back after an outage, and I don't know how to use it or reset it when comcast takes a shit on us, and it breaks ALL THE ITME, and then I don't have internet and can't upload one of my podcast episodes, and then it's 4am and I can't like WAKE him up to make him fix it, and it's INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING and I don't want his linux box to be a point of failure added to the chain that is between me and internet. I need the internet to do work, even though my work is not legitimate work and is paying me minimum wage for a tenth of the hours that I do. 

Also Fritz doesn't take my work seriously at all and gets mad at me for being "unavailable" because I'm whoring on the teamliquid forums and reddit all the time. It's important to me. Why can't people around me understand that certain things are important to me and I want to do them well? Why do they belittle my accomplishments? It feels really bad, like the time Ryan tossed my Marianne Moore paper on the ground without reading past the first page and said that I got an A on it because nobody understands this shit.

Extrinsic vs. intrinsic motivation. 

I dont' know what to do.

I'm having a difficult time. Courtney told me to figure out what I wanted to do tomorrow, this week, this month, and to go for it and live in the moment (but not in the ADD way that I currently "live in the moment", where I'm late to things because I can't leave the thing I'm currently at). 

What could be on this list? Finishing my resume and applying to the internship at Riot. Putting on more kickass Starcraft events. Upholding my 25mts podcast to a higher level of professionalism. Going to work on video editing. Recording and uploading audio and video for Spot.

Working on a minor Na'vi language lesson video series. Getting back into Dusty's ATA podcast! Keeping in touch with all these people, because I like them a lot.

Making an LED cube and programming it to act as a 3d monitor to display what my Kinect camera sees. Downloading the newest open Kinect stuff that allows you to easily map movements to keypresses. 

Most of this stuff feels hard to validate, though, or legitimize. Like "networking with the Starcraft community." How do you measure or reward progress in this?

Cleaning my room. We just moved. All my stuff is everywhere, in the garage, in my room, stacked in boxes, lumped in black garbage bags. You can't walk in my room and I feel totally claustrophobic. 

I'm deeply anxious, all the time. Deeply unsettled in my gut, in my heart, unhappy in my mind. "What's making you anxious? Find it and fix it, and you won't be anxious anymore." I don't know. I just am, and I can't get things done because of it. I'm tired, always, all the time, and I always want to be sleeping, even at 6am when I can't sleep and wish I was and I'm lying awake and unsettled, and when I do sleep I sleep extraordinarily badly with terrible stress dreams, and I'm always cold, and have no appetite and no energy or anything. First-world problems.
