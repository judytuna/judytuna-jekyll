I posted this here before, but I’ll post it again: http://www.happyproduct.com/more1.html

This is a claymation piece that is so very creepy, and so very depressing. Matt says he saw it on an IMAX screen. Man, if this is so chilling via a piece of crap 2-inch window, I can’t even imagine what it’d be like on an IMAX screen. I just watched it again, and you can see the reflections from the angly top of the spinny thing on his face in the last scene before it zooms in across the city. What detail!
