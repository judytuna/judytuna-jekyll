[maiki](http://interi.org), [Maira](http://mairasutton.net), [Parker](http://parkerhiggins.net), and other ironblogger-sf people: I think you’d like this article on reasoning by Kevin, who I went to college with: [Eager vs. Skittish Utilitarianism | melting asphalt](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/eager-vs-skittish-utilitarianism/).

I’d love to hear your thoughts, because you are also people that think about life and philosophy and perform this kind of introspection. =D
