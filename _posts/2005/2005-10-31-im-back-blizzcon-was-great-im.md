I'm BACK! Blizzcon was GREAT!! I'm sleepy! I'm going to get my murloc pet now!

A few brief vignettes:

Scene: At a Japanese restaurant. 
Mike pours beer for everyone from a pitcher. 
Mike: This is a flagon of mead.
Tyson: A typical alcoholic beverage.
Judy laughs until she cries.

Scene: Waiting in line to get our badges on the first morning.
A school bus drives by.
Kid dressed up in full dwarven battlegear complete with wig, beard, and two handaxes: NERD BUS! THERE GOES THE NERD BUS! HI NERDS!
Laura: Did you hear that kid?

Scene: Hotel room. 
Judy: SO WHAT BOSS ARE YOU ON IN BWL????
Guys who crashed our Mafia party: OMG WE'RE ON VAEL WE'VE BEEN STUCK ON HIM FOR SO LONG
Judy: OMG WE WERE TOO HE'S SO FRUSTRATING BUT SO MUCH FUN
Guy: YEAH WE WIPED ON HIM 6 TIMES THE OTHER DAY
Other Guy: YEAH WE JUST KEEP HAVING BAD LUCK, OR FUCKING UP IN SMALL WAYS, LIKE THIS ONCE, WE HAVE FOUR PRIESTS IN FULL TRANSCENDENCE, RIGHT, THREE OF THEM GOT THE FIRST THREE BAs! JUST BAD LUCK LIKE THAT. THOUGH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET BA ON A HUNTER PET
Judy: OMFG WTF HUNTER PET? I READ THAT IT WASN'T POSSIBLE FOR PETS TO GET BA-ED
[This goes on for like fifteen minutes]
There is a knock on the door. 
Security officer: I'm sorry, but we've received complaints about the noise level in this room. You're going to have to keep it down.
