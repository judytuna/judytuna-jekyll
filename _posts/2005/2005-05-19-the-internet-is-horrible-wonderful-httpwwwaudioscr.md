      <p>Yes, Dispatch is catchy and lowkey. Some of the tracks drone a bit though. I suggest "The General."</p>

The internet is horrible WONDERFUL.

[http://www.audioscrobbler.com](http://www.audioscrobbler.com/) - download a plugin for itunes, winamp etc that collects data about what music you play. upload it. compare with other users. for example i searched for [guster](http://www.audioscrobbler.com/explore/?artistname=guster) and found that people who listen to guster listen to ben folds, dispatch, howie day, dmb, bnl, the postal service, coldplay, ben kweller... having never heard of dispatch before it seems that i would really like them. i have yet to follow this lead. have any of you heard of dispatch before? it would be easy to google now, but then i would never finish this post or help ryan with any macaroon making

[http://www.livejournal.com/community/ucberkeley/916538.html](http://www.livejournal.com/community/ucberkeley/916538.html) ... my god... i cannot tell you how engrossing this thread is. i absolutely cannot tell you. the post says: post a confession, and post it anonymously. and suddenly the community explodes in heartfelt anguish and warmth and sexiness and comfort and pain and it's absolutely stunning. i cannot believe it. i read these threads and i think, "that's exactly how i feel, i can't believe i'm not alone" and read a billion posts replying "that's exactly how i feel, you're not alone" ... amazing.

I could go on. [bearhoa](http://bearhoa.livejournal.com/) has joined the lightbringers, at least part-time ;-)
