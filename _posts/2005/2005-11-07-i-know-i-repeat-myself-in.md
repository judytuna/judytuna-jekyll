I know I repeat myself in here all the time, but I don't know what I've written down because I forget things easily and I can't search my own journal because I have "forbid spiders from search engines to look at your journal" checked in my livejournal options. Anyway, I think I'm an ENFP--extroverted intuitive feeling perceiving, which http://typelogic.com/enfp.html says Ariel from the Little Mermaid is, too. Again I feel like I might have said this before but I'm not sure. It was news to me (maybe again) just now. I was looking through old emails for a DARS report because I'm confused about which breadth requirements I've finished, and I found an email that [andeja](http://andeja.livejournal.com/) sent me on 6/4/2002 at 12:06am that just said http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes2.asp
