Hong-hong has a new baby sister!!!!!!! (The newest addition is the second child of my mom's 3-sister's only son... and the first girl in the generation after mine! So far it's been nine boys!)

You can see my cousin Lily (the mom), Hong-hong, and the baby.

The baby is named 苗景璿 ... I think. I'm not really sure if that's a name. I can't read it. And I tried looking up the words at zhongwen.com and I failed, probably because I don't have Chinese software. But it shows up chinese in my email and I can copy and paste it... I don't know anything about how language software works. 

Also unsure if that'll show up in livejournal. Let us find out. 
SO CUTE!!!!!
