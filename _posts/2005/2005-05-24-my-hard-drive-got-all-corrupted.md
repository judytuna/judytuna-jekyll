      <p>Tis probably for the best. Get offline, balance your life again! I wish my computer would break, but then again I just got a new one.</p>
      <p>But if you need a temporary hard drive to get back online...</p>

      <p>I have not graduated. I am one of those people that is going to take eight years to graduate from undergrad. Things are not working out for me right now. I'm staying in Berkeley indefinitely, though.</p>
      <p>Thank you for the kind words =)</p>
      <p>How much longer are you going to be here?</p>

      <p>Re: Cultural Differences</p>
      <p>nope, but the time difference certainly makes it harder to play with your friends.  the fact that british students have way more free time and want to go out all the time helps keep you offline, too.  and the cute american girls.  but i guess you have those in california, too.</p>

      <p>Gotta Catch Em All!</p>
      <p>We do all right.<br />
      There's plenty of reasons to be out and offline in CA though, I don't think it's lack of opportunity or motivation. It's about distraction.</p>

      <p>Aw, it's ok!  You'll be like Ronald Cruz, except infinitely better and not working for DAAP.  </p>
      <p>Anyway, I'm here for another year, should all things go smoothly.  </p>

My hard drive got all corrupted again, so rather than reformat once more and continue to crash I'm sending it in for a warranty replacement. This means I'm quite WoWless. It is very, very sad.
