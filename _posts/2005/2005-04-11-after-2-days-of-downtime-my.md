After 2 days of downtime, my computer is now able to connect to the internet. 

I had to reinstall windows to make it work. 

Computers suck.

Sunken temple tonight, anyone?

The DeCadence concert was last night, but I forgot my camera. It was fun, diarrhea notwithstanding. I wore Shmarowin's grey shirt-with-a-printed-tie-on-it because I was Seargent Grey.
