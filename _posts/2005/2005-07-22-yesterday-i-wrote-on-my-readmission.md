yesterday, i wrote on my readmission application (which was too late for fall, so i turned it in for spring) that i was 21 years old. 

i am actually 22 years old. i just found a pen and subtraced 1982 from 2004 (since october 2005 hasn't happened yet) to figure this out. should i like, call them to correct this error or something? becuase by the time they process the readmission application for next spring, i will apparently be 23.

it's a little weird that i don't know how old i am. am i really 22? i honestly thought i was 21. goes to show that doing nothing for a year makes you feel like a year hasn't passed.

i have to say it out loud: i just wasted a year. i did nothing in a WHOLE YEAR. a year is a long time.
