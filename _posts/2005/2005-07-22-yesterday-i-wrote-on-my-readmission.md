      <p>Actually, I have to stop and think about how old I am too. After a certain age (somewhere around 21), you stop keeping careful count.<br />
      A)It's not a big event that you think about it occasionally all year.<br />
      B)It doesn't make much of a difference in how people treat you or how you're supposed to be treated.<br />
      C)It can actually be stressful to keep track...<br />
      and finally,<br />
      D)+20 candles is way too many to have on a cake (even an ice cream cake!).</p>
      <p>In any case, if you've experienced the boredom of doing nothing... why not try <i>something</i> for a change? I can practically <i>guarantee</i> it's better than nothing. </p>
      <p>You must be <i>starving</i> for a little academic action, and even the merest effort will make you feel better than you seem to be feeling, because it's still progress towards completion. I'm guessing it'll feel so good you won't need to consciously "work" at it as much as you think. It's easier to be excited about classes when you're bored!</p>
      <p>Yay for continuing! Boo for worrying about time off!<br />
      Go Judy, go!<br />

      <p>I think everyone's entitled to wasted years. :-) I still wonder why I've only been out of college 2 years and don't know any one in the singing groups any more. Shouldn't I have to wait another... oh that's right, I've been out of college 3 years, but I have the missing year when I was looking for work.</p>
      <p>And really if you think about it, you've probably done a lot more than you give yourself credit for in that one year. I used to mope about my missing year, but I now realize during that time, I saw Cal win a Big Game, I got into a bike accident that required stitches, I got into my first car accident, I got to experience the desperate month to month apartment hunt with little money, I got a drivers license, I discovered the wonder of 24 hour taquerias, etc. Sure they're little things, but if you add it up, is all the life experience from that 1 year "wasted"? Even the miserable things (that bike accident, being jobless, thousands of dollars in debt, being forced to live at home with crazy family situation when I could handle no more debt)... all in all I did a lot, and learned a lot.</p>
      <p>For you, all the places you've hiked to (I'm jealous!), the China trip (I'm sure you'll look back on it one day and remember some of the better things, right? You freaking got to experience everyday life in another country!).... I'm sure I'm missing a lot more since I'm a little out of the loop, but think about it... the year was NOT wasted.</p>
      <p>And if you don't wanna keep "wasting" years, find something to focus on. Get the job this semester, and focus on finishing school the next. You're so close, and I'm sure finishing will make you feel better about things.</p>

      <p>Thanks, mike. </p>
      <p>At least I haven't gotten into crashes which require stitches. Yikes =(</p>
      <p>(Though I'm not glad I went to China. I would honestly rather forget about that trip. While we were there, the leaders kept saying to us, "You will look back and remember it as one of the best times of your life!" and we all mocked them for that. However, in some mass "let's try to keep in touch" emails that were sent a few months ago, some of the people who were the most cynical while there said "it sucked, but I'm so glad I went, and it was one of the best times of my life!" and I felt... betrayed or something. Because I'm not glad I went, and while there I talked to those people about how shitty we all felt, so I thought that they'd be the least likely to turn around and say "best experience of life" a few months later or something. I sound so peevish. "Oh I'm so mad that they have happy memories to look back on." Ha ha. In short, no, I will never look back on it and remember the better things. There were no better things. *turns into massive brown ogre*)</p>

yesterday, i wrote on my readmission application (which was too late for fall, so i turned it in for spring) that i was 21 years old. 

i am actually 22 years old. i just found a pen and subtraced 1982 from 2004 (since october 2005 hasn't happened yet) to figure this out. should i like, call them to correct this error or something? becuase by the time they process the readmission application for next spring, i will apparently be 23.

it's a little weird that i don't know how old i am. am i really 22? i honestly thought i was 21. goes to show that doing nothing for a year makes you feel like a year hasn't passed.

i have to say it out loud: i just wasted a year. i did nothing in a WHOLE YEAR. a year is a long time.
