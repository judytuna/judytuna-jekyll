      <p>and how!</p>
      <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lick" rel="nofollow">James Lick</a> was a total crazy. He almost built a pyramid in the middle of SF for himself. He was convinced to build the world's biggest refractor telescope (at the time) instead. Fortunately. And then he demanded that his body be interred at the base of the telescope. So it is.</p>
