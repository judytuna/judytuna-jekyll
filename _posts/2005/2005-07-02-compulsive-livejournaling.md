Who was I talking to about this the other day? Elanor?? Syzygy means "the nearly straight-line configuration of three celestial bodies (as the sun, moon, and earth during a solar or lunar eclipse) in a gravitational system." I had to look this up, which shows that I was never as good of an X-Files fan as I aspired to be (I'm sure I  knew what it meant then, but I'd since forgotten).
