      <p>Yeah, she had to explain it to me too, as part of the explanation for FTL.</p>
      <p>I thought FTL meant "Faster-Than-Light" as in a Sci-fi FTL drive.<br />
      So, "crankiness FTL" didn't make too much sense to me.. except with regards to the <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/judytuna/115980.html" rel="nofollow">speed of crankiness</a> law (see comments on link)</p>
