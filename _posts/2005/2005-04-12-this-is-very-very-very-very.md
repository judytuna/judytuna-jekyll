      <p>World of Burgercraft is *soooo* last month! Get with the program and read the forums more religiously like I do at work.... wait a sec....</p>
      <p>And get back on to AOL IM. I need more distractions at work when I can't play WoW!<br />

      <p>Hi Judy~ what are you doing this Saturday?  Because if you are free... it is my bday on the 16th, and I'm leaving for Japan on the 20th, so I decided to have a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles party!  YeAHHHh!!  Hahaha... so yeah, it'll go from 8pm til whenever; no dress code, but I've been telling people "bring your own weapon" haha... there'll be pizza, green drinks, the original NES game, the 3 movies, etc. But yeah, it'd be cool to see you there ;)</p>

      <p>Yeah, I only read the forums sporadically. When I posted my response (Lynne is my pally on my other server I play on with high school friends), I didn't know that the guy hadn't come up with that whole thing himself on the spot. Ah well</p>
