Edit 2/18: it was the printer cartdrige. The printer was giving me errors with the new cartridge in becuase it wanted me to take it out and put it in again, which I did that night, and then everything worked fine--I hadn't figured this out because I didn't look at the printer and what it was trying to tell me. /shrug

My printer is completely fuxxored. 
1) I like to print out lecture notes 2 pages per sheet. Saves paper. Usually it's readable, but the pdfs I was printing from used really small text and had huge margins, so I thought, "you should be able to tell the printer to zoom in! yeah that would be perfect!" Yesterday I tried to tweak the zoom in "page setup," and then it printed weird half-lines of text. "Weird," I thought. "Oh well, I'll deal with it later."
2) Sending a printer test page from the printer window works perfectly, so I know it's not because of ink.
3) Today, I tried again, thinking "not only has my computer been restarted, it's been off for a night, and surely it must be just an adobe reader problem, and surely it has reverted back to its default printing settings again." So I tried printing, after looking around at the settings and seeing that yes they had reverted back to the default. Then I tried printing... with the same results as yesterday. "Fuck it," I said, "I'll print it from notepad," since I'd noticed that you could select the text in a pdf. Turns out printing from NOTEPAD is fuxxored as well--a few half-lines of something that is barely recognizable as a middle fraction of a line of text. Same thing. But... again, printing a test page from the printer window works fine, and so does printing a random webpage from firefox. 
4) The troubleshooter said, "why don't you try these steps to print from the command-line?" "Ok," I said. It said, "If your printer prints a page with the directory listing, then the connection between your printer and your computer is fine." When I followed the instructions, the printer spat out about a dozen sheets of empty paper. I am unsure of whether this means ... anything.
5) I looked at the ports, cuz the troubleshooter told me to. The PSC uses port "DOT4_001". WTF? So I tried setting it to lpt1, too. Nothing. The description of lpt1 is "printer port." The description of DOT4_001 is "PSC500" (the name of my printer). So like is DPT4_001 some special port that HP made up or something? WTF??
6) I try notepad again. This time, "the document failed to print." Why? I check the printer window. "Error," it very helpfully points out. WTF???
7) I try wordpad, just for the fuck of it. I press "print." It shows the little "printing" window--says it's sending it to PSC500 on LPT1. The little printing window goes away. Nothing ever goes into the printing queue. My printer doesn't do anything. WTF??????
8) I think I must be insane, so I change the black ink cartridge anyway. No change.
9) I remember that printing from firefox worked. I slap html and body and pre on the Notepad file, change the ending to .html, and open the text in firefox. I press print. "Error," it says. "This document failed to print," it says. I press cancel. It hangs forever on "Error - restart - printing." Ok, I've really fucked everything up.
9) I am very perplexed.
10) I write perplexed livejournal entry to show my perplexedness. Plooplut motherfucker.
