My friend [mbarrien](http://mbarrien.livejournal.com/) is in an a cappella group named Redshift. They’re having [auditions](http://www.livejournal.com/users/mbarrien/59800.html) soon. (That’s a link to the ad Mike posted on his lj.) Anyway, I’m posting this just in case anyone out there is interested.
