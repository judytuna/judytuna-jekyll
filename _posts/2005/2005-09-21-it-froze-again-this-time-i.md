It froze again. This time I lost a cover letter. I never learn.

Edit 10:00AM: Ok, I didn't lose the cover letter. I had already copy-pasted it into the text of my email program, which has never crashed. But Word froze three seconds after opening up the file again, as it was loading the "autosave" data. 

Lame.
