The end of the trailer for "Unleashed" (Jet Li) has the instrumental backings (no vocals) from Muse's "Apocalypse Please." I like Muse. I like pianos. I don't know what to think about the new Jet Li movie. It'll make good use of the "Jet Li looks so cute and unassuming but actually he has lethal powers" thing, like all Jet Li movies do I guess. The new iTunes music store lets you browse movie trailers and music videos. This, and spending all day yesterday reformatting my computer, explains my absence from WoW.
