      <p>I wasn't even thinking of Matrix when I said that. (I actively block out memories of the last 2 Matrix films....)</p>
      <p>I've just been annoyed at the scratchy stuff, and have been looking for the finer things in life. :-P</p>

      <p>Stormwind =) The spires are the top of the SW cathedral. You have to look up to see them... I didn't even notice them until I'd been playing the game for a few months! Hehe.</p>
      <p>I'm on Lightbringer... I hope you're doing well over on Silvermoon! My knowledge of things alliance is obsessive, but I've only played horde to 10 =) </p>

      <p>Paper bags is where it's at!  When I'm at the grocery store and they ask me "Paper or plastic?" I say "Paper!" with a big grin on my face.</p>

      <p>Ha. I remember you complained about the natural made-from-recycled-paper toilet paper I used to buy. To me toilet paper is toilet paper.</p>
