      <p>I love that piece!  It's so great and moving and like bitter and commentary at the same time.  Aand I love the music in it too!  I want to know where they got the music for that.  I've seen it twice on Intensity TV on PBS.</p>

      <p>This has been out for a while.. but yeah. Creepy.<br />
      It kinda reminds me of a Blue Man Group music video (now <i>that</i> was a short-lived fad).</p>

      <p>When Kenna first used that song for their Hell Bent video I thought for a while I liked the band 'til I realized I just liked the animation.</p>

      <p>I just spent a minute or so trying to figure out how to spell out a shudder.  It's hard.</p>

I posted this here before, but I'll post it again: http://www.happyproduct.com/more1.html

This is a claymation piece that is so very creepy, and so very depressing. Matt says he saw it on an IMAX screen. Man, if this is so chilling via a piece of crap 2-inch window, I can't even imagine what it'd be like on an IMAX screen. I just watched it again, and you can see the reflections from the angly top of the spinny thing on his face in the last scene before it zooms in across the city. What detail!
