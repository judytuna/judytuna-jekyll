plaguelands (complete with flight paths between towers in the zone), silithus

buff will even hit people inside instances-- AQ/strat

i was imagining that the objective to "objective-based pvp" would be something like a graveyard, but i guess a zone-wide buff would make sense. it would motivate more people to do participate... maybe. the reverse argument would be that everyone in the zone (including chinese farmer bots goddamn them to hell) gets a buff for only a few people doing the work (and the people inside the instances are definitely not working on pvp objectives in the zone)... wonder how it'll work out. 

are the test servers up yet? do they have this stuff already?
