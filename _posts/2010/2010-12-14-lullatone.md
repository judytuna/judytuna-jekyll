After maiki [wrote about Lullatone](http://interi.org/2010/11/lullatone/), I got [Songs that Spin in Circles](http://lullatone.bandcamp.com/album/songs-that-spin-in-circles) because I am trying to relax. I like it. =) I’ll probably get [Looping Lullabies](http://lullatone.bandcamp.com/album/looping-lullabies) next. 

I like the pure instrumentals more than the ones with vocals, even if they are background-level. I particularly like “Tops on a Table”, because it’s got this punchy quality, like the mechanical sound that toy pianos make. I like the dropping mechanical sound.

ps. Spam count: 5 now!!

Edit 2:51pm: I just transferred the Lullatone album to my desktop, where there are speakers, and WOW, there’s bass. Especially on Merry-go-round… bass like a heartbeat. I like it even more now.

I need to come up with a way to sync my iTunes libraries between my PC and my Mac so that I can update my iPod via either of them. o.O
