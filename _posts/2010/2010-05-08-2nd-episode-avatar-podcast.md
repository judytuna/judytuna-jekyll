i worked a little on this episode!

http://RadioAvatar.podOmatic.com/entry/2010-05-08T02_26_19-07_00

my audacity screwed up and recorded all the audio (instead of just me, as is supposed to happen), so a lot of my "best work" according to the tsahik were unusable =( but you can hear me singing the star wars theme and getting shot down right at the beginning. ROFL

it's fun to work on and i'm looking forward to doing more. don't get any nerdier than discussing movie scenes.

edited to add: ew i sound so... overly emphatic. gah is that how i always sound when i talk?

i appear in two things--the scene discussion in the beginning, and the "language lesson" in the middle (like 35 min through)
