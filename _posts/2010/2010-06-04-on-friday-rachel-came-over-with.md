On Friday, Rachel came over with her screenprinting stuff. It's a Yudu: http://www.whatdoyudu.com/  She also brought her Print Gocco setup. One-time-use bulbs and all.
K and [lemmingsolution](http://lemmingsolution.livejournal.com/) and R drew some designs and R burned some screens beforehand. 
Tights were an epic failure, but tshirts were an epic success.
