**E**: steer clear of sugary coffee drinks.

  and blue bottle.

  24th and folsom.

**C**:  Coffee advice, straight from the internet:
http://theoatmeal.com/comics/coffee

**A**: start with lattes, soy if you're lactose intolerant
  the milk helps dilute the caffeine
  and espresso is cleaner than regular coffee
  the filtration is quicker, with more steam and will cause less jitters
  peet's is probably not great for your first kind of coffee
  like crack
  it's just usually not for beginners
  i get super shaky and i've been drinking coffee for about eight years

**P**: They say it's best if the water is not quite boiling when it hits the grounds, like 90 degrees Celsius.
   There are certain oils in the beans that come out if you use boiling temperature water that give the coffee a sharp bitter flavor.... I mean sharper and bitterer than coffee.
   If you're making a lot of coffee, like several gallons, Joy of Cooking says to put a whole egg in with the grounds. I'm not sure why.
   Like, with the shell.
   I don't know why? The egg absorbs something, maybe.

I got a http://www.aerobie.com/Products/aeropress_story.htm because Dylan got one before he went to New York. $25 on amazon. Now I just need to get coffee to put in it. The idea is: instead of thinking "oh god, it's morning, i have to get up," i can now instead think "ha-ha, now i will play with a new gadget. judy loves gadgets"
