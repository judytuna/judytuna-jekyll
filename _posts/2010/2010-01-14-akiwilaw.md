  book

  Watch out for the initial glottal stop!

edit: lol. this is a test. no, i don't think i'll always post my hupa word of the day here, but i just wanted to try it and see how it works. the blog is just for keeping track of the hupa words of the day that ramon gives me. the next step: i want to convince him to record himself pronouncing them, and i chose postulous expressly because it is made for hosting files. it'll automatically make a thing that'll play the sound file from your browser. if we keep it up maybe i'll actually learn more hupa than "she cried" and "otter"
