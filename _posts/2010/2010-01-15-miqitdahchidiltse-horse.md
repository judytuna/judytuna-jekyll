      <p>I need more from this data set! I want to figure out how to express "livejournal." I bet it's like book but with additions. "It glows and is marked."</p>

      <p>no word for "live" as in "live wire" ... the only "live" is the one about where you are living</p>
      <p>alive, be:<br />
      whixinay’ [=‘my survival, escape’] I’m alive, I’m surviving, I’m safe;<br />
      xoxinay’ he is alive;<br />
      xa:t’i-whixinay’ I am still alive</p>
      <p>no journal, but there's</p>
      <p>typewriter:  ’a:da:-k’i¬’e:n [=‘by itself-it writes’]<br />
      typewriter; computer</p>
      <p>HAHAH</p>
      <p>OR we could go the somewhat-obscure meaning way, but we'd have to decide on a meaning. like....<br />
      - on it, the children are emo<br />
      - in it, she drums<br />
      - it glows and is marked.... there is no word for glow, but there is... </p>
      <p>dawn:  yi¬xa (or yi¬xay) it is dawning, day is breaking<br />
       • yisxa:n  it has dawned, the day has arrived<br />
       • xoh¬iq’ay-tehsyay  [=‘whiteness-goes along’] the ﬁ rst<br />
      light of dawn showing in the sky </p>
      <p>light shines:  k’ininde:n it shines (e.g., a light bulb,<br />
      star, sun), there is a light;  k’ine:nde’n  it lit up;<br />
      k’ini¬ding light it up! shine a light on it! turn the light<br />
      on!; k’ine’wi¬de’n he lit it up</p>
