holy shit! i hear horns, people screaming, firecrackers... it's really crazy out there, and i'm sick in my room with stuffy sinuses and the windows closed. this is totally nuts.

edit 8:22pm... it's fucking insane!!! there's a mob outside of the corner store across the street and they're just in the middle of the street, pouring beer on each other and on cars, and a police car drove by with all their lights on and HIGH-FIVED THE CROWD and everyone jumped over and banged on THE POLICE CAR WTF!! ... i saw a guy rev his motorcycle and spin out his back wheel to make a bunch of smoke, then he took off and DID A WHEELIE DOWN THE HILL! i didn't get a video of that, but holy shit!

videos that i did get: 
--police car with policemen high fiving people http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmyMRW2Vg7E
