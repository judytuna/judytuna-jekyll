**Muse**
Here is the entirety of Muse's Seattle show from 4/2 http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoid=104720086
=)
WE MUST RUUUUUUNNNNN

And Muse wrote a song that will be the "lead single to be released from the soundtrack of the new Twilight film 'Eclipse'" HAHAHAHAH. *Neutron Star Collision (Love Is Forever)"* HAHAH!! Comes out on May 17. Oh, Stephanie Meyer, with all your wishes coming true.

AND they are coming back 28th Sept: Arco Arena, Sacramento, CA

**Vienna Teng**
I think I'm going to buy this wooden Vienna Teng USB drive (2 gigs, $20, comes with all the files from the new live album) instead of the CD version. http://viennateng.portmerch.com/stores/product.php?productid=17394&cat=0&page=1&featured

She is going back to school. http://viennateng.com/scrapbook/2010/03/new-chapter/ MBA in green business. So the last time to see her live for a while is coming up -- she's doing FOUR shows in 2 days at Yoshi's in SF -- May 15 and 16.

Also, I'm sorry about the posterous spam. I've been using it to get my files to people for our recording sessions for the 2nd episode of the first Avatar fan podcast. I thought I fixed it so that it won't auto-update my livejournal anymore, but obviously I didn't.
