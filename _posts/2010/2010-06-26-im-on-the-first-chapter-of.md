i'm on the first chapter of this very gentle rails tutorial: http://www.railstutorial.org/book

so far, i have: 
1. found out that ruby and rails and gems are already installed on my macbook
2. installed a couple of new text editors (it's been a long time. maybe i can find my old .emacs file from like 2002 somewhere)
3. created my first project (it is just a skeleton)
4. messed around with git. haha.
5. deployed the skeleton app on [heroku](http://high-flower-21.heroku.com/).
