      <p>I found it on the floor where it fell out of my pocket. Goddamnit!! It had fallen behind my hamper where my jeans had slumped. Oh well. Maybe I can cut apart the old one and see what's inside.</p>

I haven't been able to find my bart EZRider card since I last used it on Saturday, so I just ordered a new one. $5 replacement fee. I checked the log and it hasn't been used since then, at least. Now that I've put the order through, I'll probably find it on the floor where it fell out of my pocket. Expect an update when I do.
