I got it to work! I got both [libfreenect](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect/) and [ofxKinect](https://github.com/ofTheo/ofxKinect) to compile and run. The community has figured out how to get access to the regular video camera, the IR camera for depth, the status LED, and the tilt on the Kinect. No mic access yet, but it's only a matter of time, I think.

There isn't much else to do right now, because I haven't managed to make sense of any of the code. At some point I'd like to magically become a programmer again and make some Kinect apps for fun, but I'm a long way away. For now, here's some proof that I've got it to work =D

ofxKinect is mac-only. It comes with blob detection. It uses darker grey to show if something is closer to the Kinect.

libfreenect is for mac, windows, and unix. It uses a rainbow of colors to show the topographical map. Very striking. I spent a lot of time staring at myself with my mouth open.
