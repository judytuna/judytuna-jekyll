      Win. It's been about two months now that I've played a game of LoL. You've piqued my interest. As soon as my boy wakes up from his nap, I'm going to share this song with him! Thanks for sharing.

      Haha, glad you enjoyed it! To tell the complete truth, I haven't been playing as much LoL as I used to. It's all about Starcraft 2 now. But I get the occasional game in now and then, and my podcast people are super-duper dedicated. I get all the latest patch notes and metagame info from listening to them, haha.

      Did your boy like it? lol

      PS. Are you brave? http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=166147

Tonight, I made [Spot the Octopus](http://spottheoctop.us) sing [two holiday carols](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/em3c4/league_of_legends_holiday_carols_anyone/) for [25MTS](http://25minstosurrender.podomatic.com)!

1. [Spot the Octopus - League of Legends Jingle Bells]({{ "assets/images/2010/12/LOL-Jingle-Bells.mp3" | relative_url }})

2. Twelve Days of Snowdown, but, uh, I can't upload things > 2 mb. haha

Well, here they both are on Posterous, because it has a built-in flash player. [http://spottheoctopus.posterous.com/spot-sings-lol-holiday-carols](http://spottheoctopus.posterous.com/spot-sings-lol-holiday-carols)

Lyrics:

**Jingle Bells**

Flashing through the snow
whole team M I A
o'er the lane we go
ganking all the way

Bells on Kog'maw ring
ace the last team fight
what fun it is to /taunt and sing
a SLAYING song tonight

O!
Jingle bells, cho'gath smells
Singed is drunk on nogg,
Mundo mash, Udyr smash
and Trundle's left his bog...

Jingle bells, Trynda wails
Anivia laid an egg
Evelynn fed the Xin
and Gangplank lost a leg!

**12 Days of Snowdown**

On the first day of Snowdown, my Sum'ner gave to me, a Garen spinning in a tree.
On the second day of Snowdown, my Sum'ner gave to me, two feeders bottom
On the third day of Snowdown, my Sum'ner gave to me, three freakin' ninjas
On the fourth day of Snowdown, my Sum'ner gave to me, four neutral wraiths
On the fifth day of Snowdown, my Sum'ner gave to me, five Hearts of Gold
On the sixth day of Snowdown, my Sum'ner gave to me, six minions marching
On the seventh day of Snowdown, my Sum'ner gave to me, Seven Christmas skins
On the eight day of Snowdown, my Sum'ner gave to me, eight Rammus Tremors
On the ninth day of Snowdown, my Sum'ner gave to me, nine stacks on mejai's
On the tenth day of Snowdown, my Sum'ner gave to me, 10 champs-a-fighting
On the eleventh day of Snowdown, my Sum'ner gave to me, eleven Turrets shooting
On the twelfth day of Snowdown, my Sum'ner gave to me, twelve Jungle Camps
