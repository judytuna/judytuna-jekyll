Tonight, I made [Spot the Octopus](http://spottheoctopus.com) sing [two holiday carols](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/em3c4/league_of_legends_holiday_carols_anyone/) for [25MTS](http://25minstosurrender.podomatic.com)!

1. [Spot the Octopus – League of Legends Jingle Bells](https://judytuna.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/LOL-Jingle-Bells.mp3)

2. Twelve Days of Snowdown, but, uh, I can’t upload things > 2 mb. haha

Well, here they both are on Posterous, because it has a built-in flash player. [http://spottheoctopus.posterous.com/spot-sings-lol-holiday-carols](http://spottheoctopus.posterous.com/spot-sings-lol-holiday-carols)

Lyrics: 

**Jingle Bells**

Flashing through the snow

whole team M I A

o’er the lane we go

ganking all the way

Bells on Kog’maw ring

ace the last team fight

what fun it is to /taunt and sing

a SLAYING song tonight

O!

Jingle bells, cho’gath smells

Singed is drunk on nogg,

Mundo mash, Udyr smash

and Trundle’s left his bog…

Jingle bells, Trynda wails

Anivia laid an egg

Evelynn fed the Xin

and Gangplank lost a leg!

**12 Days of Snowdown**

On the first day of Snowdown, my Sum’ner gave to me, a Garen spinning in a tree.

On the second day of Snowdown, my Sum’ner gave to me, two feeders bottom

On the third day of Snowdown, my Sum’ner gave to me, three freakin’ ninjas

On the fourth day of Snowdown, my Sum’ner gave to me, four neutral wraiths

On the fifth day of Snowdown, my Sum’ner gave to me, five Hearts of Gold

On the sixth day of Snowdown, my Sum’ner gave to me, six minions marching

On the seventh day of Snowdown, my Sum’ner gave to me, Seven Christmas skins

On the eight day of Snowdown, my Sum’ner gave to me, eight Rammus Tremors

On the ninth day of Snowdown, my Sum’ner gave to me, nine stacks on mejai’s

On the tenth day of Snowdown, my Sum’ner gave to me, 10 champs-a-fighting

On the eleventh day of Snowdown, my Sum’ner gave to me, eleven Turrets shooting

On the twelfth day of Snowdown, my Sum’ner gave to me, twelve Jungle Camps
