Dear world, 

Do you guys know anyone looking for housing in san francisco? Single room for $725/month (security deposit is $725, utilities (internet, power, gas) run about $30/mo per person). Starting May 1.

Four people total in a three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment. Fritz (25, undergrad student at SFSU in elec. engineering) and I (27, working across the bay) share one of the rooms and bathrooms, and the other two rooms share the other bathroom. Dat (27, grad student at SFSU in kinesiology) is staying. (Sarah, 23 and a grad student in forensic psychology, is the one moving out before May 1). 

The apartment's pretty sweet. Big kitchen, two big sunny common areas (we use one for a dining room, and the other for a living room with couches/TVs/game systems/netflix player/music room). Our instrument collection is looking nicer--I've got an acoustic guitar, Fritz has an electric keyboard and a mandolin and an electric bass, and Dat has an electric guitar and a drumset (drumset is set up in the garage, with pieces from Fritz's drumset mixed in). We started trying to play some music together and got an Eisley song up and running, but haven't played together lately. Uh. I like Muse and Vienna Teng. Dat likes indie. Fritz likes everything.

We're on Mission St, south of the numbers. We're between 24th st and glen park bart stations (glen park is a bit closer so that's where I walk to go to work, but at night when I come home, I get off at 24th st because the 14 and the 49 take me to my doorstep. Literally. The bus stops in front of our apartment. It is awesome.)
