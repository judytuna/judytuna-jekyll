and i jizzed

in

my pants.

saw nintendogs+cats on their channel too. since the touch screen is the bottom one, and the 3d is the top one, they had to make a paper doll for your cat on the bottom screen for you to touch with the stylus, and you watch a representation of your hand on the 3d screen on top. thatâ€™s a little awkward, but i guess they had no choice. (in old nintendogs, you just pet your doggy on the bottom screen)
