      <p>I had never seen that video. It's freaky on so many levels! Erasure is *so* gay it seems *wrong* to have dude even singing to a girl.... oh yeah, and the costuming or whatever. Plus people's comments on the video about what they interpret the story to be, are like whoa. I did NOT get that out of it. </p>
