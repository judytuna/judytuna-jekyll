The tyranny of somethinglessness

Otherwise: on thurs there was a Wikipedia engineering meet up in sf! On fri we had one last rehearsal and on Saturday Spot the Octopus had an amazing concert! Today we went rock climbing and I met some women who love magic the gathering and warhammer and bouldering! And I did two 10c climbs! Not easily but still. I donâ€™t give up!

Okay! Good night!
