Here I am, in Houston! One day I will sit down and figure out a process of getting pictures from my phone onto Something That Is Convenient For Display On Mah Blaugh and then I will be able to easily post this picture I just took of a bronze statue of George HW Bush in the Houston airport, but for now, words must suffice. 

Why am I going to Amsterdam? 
- I got [a talk accepted](http://www.mobileconference.nl/talks#judy-interactive-3d-for-mobile-web) to the [Dutch Mobile Conference](http://www.mobileconference.nl/)! I will be speaking about Three.js as a developing way to display 3d graphics on a phone. 
- I arranged my travel such that I would be able to attend the [Wikipedia Hackathon in Amsterdam](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Amsterdam_Hackathon_2013)!!!
- There happens to be a [Muse concert](http://muse.mu/tour-dates,amsterdam-arena-amsterdam-netherlands_1811.htm) while I'll be there! 
- Maybe I'll take the train to Paris or something!

Yesterday morning, I made it onto my plane for my 8:50am flight out of SFO and to Houston, where I was supposed to make a connection to Amsterdam, but there was a mechanical failure, so we all had to deplane. We all got on another plane three hours later. United Airlines put me up in this Holiday Inn in Houston for a night. I'm bound for the Houston airport again now to get on a new flight to AMS!
