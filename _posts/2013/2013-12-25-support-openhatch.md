OpenHatch is running a crowdfunding campaign! https://openhatch.org/donate/ Please throw dollars at OH so they can run more Open Source Comes To Campus events and bring skills/knowhow/cookies to people who are interested in contributing to open source but don't know where to begin. Help them succeed in their mission of increasing diversity in open source!

Clearly, the custom Sufjan drawing is the best perk. BABBY PENGUINS FOR EVERYONE

I have [volunteered](http://www.flickr.com/photos/judytuna/sets/72157639005693554/) at just one OpenHatch event, and it was awesome. I rambled about different paths to software and taught a whole lot of people how to submit pull requests on github. My sister has attended one too, in Boston, and brought people and learned a bunch.
