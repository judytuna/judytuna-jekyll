I had a totally uneventful flight (hooray!). I watched Life of Pi (Ang Lee! Also I loved the book when I devoured it, years ago, wrapped in bed and wracked with doubt, adrift in my own sea of turmoil) and then, immediately, Les Mis, which is such a stupid story I could barely stand it. Curiously, I'd never seen Les Mis in any form all the way through--I'd only caught glimpses of the version they used to play on kqed channel 9 all the time, where they didn't have the full stage setting and the orchestra was on stage and the actors performed in front of skinny microphones, and even then I only ever paid attention to Lea Salonga, who is captivating and gorgeous and talented and expressive. I'd heard the names Gavroche, Fantine, Cosette, Marius, and Eponine, and now I know who they are, and bemoan their uselessness. 'ponine, you could be so much more interesting, and there are other fish in the sea, and anyawy you need a sassy gay friend oh look [someone made one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60lfMiWzSr8) and also how do you make double quotes on a European computer? I keep typing it and then mashing the keys and then deleting the äs that appear.

Anyway that's not what I was trying to talk about. Here are my Amsterdam adventures so far: 
- sat in airport lobby and read these travel books maiki gave me and finally decided to go to a library
- wandered around the airport trying to buy a power converter that would take my three-pronged plug for my laptop charger. Discovered, after choosing one, that I was still in the duty-free zone, and I wasn't allowed to buy there after I deboarded. You're only allowed to buy stuff there if you're waiting to get on a flight, or something. 
- Bought one elsewhere, along with a small backpack that I plan to use when I get home too. It's green.
- Wandered around the giant section of the airport that says "train tickets here" (oh the way to make double quotes reliably is to press the key, then type a consonant!). Was stymied by the machines not taking my credit card or atm card (although both had just worked elsewhere). Finally discovered that only 1 in like 10 of the machines takes coins (and none of them appeared to take bills). Successfully bought a ticket to Amsterdam Centraal. 
- Wandered around the station for a long time looking at maps trying to figure out how to figure out which train would take me to Amsterdam Centraal. Asked some people who were looking for a machine that took cash (and I helped them find one), who helped me. 
- Got on the train as the doors were closing. The first car appeared to be a bike car. The train is beautiful, sort of like caltrain, but more well-used, and prettier, and smooth! Rode a few stops. 
- Got out! Walked outside! Into the rain!
- Went back inside! Walked into some kind of drugstore-ish thing that sold everything from clothing to chocolates and bought the most offensive umbrella I could find (it's orange with flowers! I had a hard time choosing between this orange one and the pink one with pinkish reddish carnations, but I'm glad I got the orange). 
- Walked towards the library! Passed reams and reams of parked bicycles! Have never seen so many parked bikes in my life! Thought about renting a bike, but haven't yet! 
- Wandered around inside the library, which is white and huge (7 stories tall I think?) and covered in giant windows and recessed LED lighting on the shelves and so bright inside and full of interesting-looking students hard at work! Dismayed to find taht accessing their wifi is €1 per 30 minutes, and not free, like this tour book said (maybe things changed snice publication). Bought 30 minutes at a paystation. 
- Their wifi login system isn't working and an employee confirmed as much. Logged onto a public workstation instead (they are plentiful and line these balconies). Am sad about the continued inability to post pictures. I guess I could transfer them from my phone to my computer adn then from my computer to this public workstation via usb drive .... 

Anyway, I'm figuring out stuff about the [Wikipedia Engineering Meetup/Hackathon in Amsterdam](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Amsterdam_Hackathon_2013) now hooray! Also, trying to figure out my phone situation. Maybe I should go get the cheapest prepaid feature phone I can find so I can call/sms or something.
