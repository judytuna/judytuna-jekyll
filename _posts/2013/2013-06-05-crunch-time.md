      Ah yeah, Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis - Can't Hold Us (feat. Ray Dalton). The song is pretty popular atm... I've seen them perform on SNL, Late Show with David Letterman, and Conan, and the song is being used in Microsoft's Outlook.com ads (that's actually where I first heard it). In fact, it was pretty funny when the Outlook.com ad was shown and shortly after they performed it on SNL when SNL returned. Seems to be an independent artist.

Ally and I ate a lot of falafel on Leidseplein last night at this awesome [salad bar](https://foursquare.com/judytuna/checkin/51ae67fd498ea2a43a726770), then barhopped all night. I really love this area just south of Leidseplein. And it was an accident--we had found a cheap Best Western here. I'm pretty behind on blogging! 

The livenation.nl website didn't take american credit cards, so I wasn't prepared for the Muse concert--I was sort of thinking I'd go down to the arena to buy a ticket. Then it was 45 minutes away by tram and I ... had inertia. This is really weird--a few years ago, it would have been COMPLETELY UNTHINKABLE for me to miss Muse in my city for ANYTHING. But traveling alone can be hard, and so when Ally said "Bad Religion is playing tonight! I loved them!" I was like "hmm maybe that instead" once I found out that the venue they were playing at was like 3 minutes away and I guess I want to do things with people. 

Laura is going to KILL me. 

She will KILL me. 

I guess this is me feeling some regret, but at least I'm writing it down here as an indication that I am okay living with my choice. haha. It was also like less than half the price. I suppose I could have tried using craigslist or finding stuff. Well...

I still had fun and the Melkweg was a really cool venue, so I'm glad I went to *something*! And I'm into BR more and more these days anyway. I could sing along during "sorrow" and such. Found an area upstairs pretty close the stage actually where there were a bunch of girls so I stood near them, because it was less scary than standing near a lot of large dudes. haha.

After the falafel, I saw some people on Liedes square and one was wearing a Muse tshirt so I was like OMG HOW WAS IT? and they were like IT WAS GREAT BUT THEY DIDN'T PLAY HYSTERIA???? and I was like I SAW BAD RELIGION INSTEAD BUT MUSE IS MY FAVORITE BAND IVE SEEN THEM EIGHT TIMES LIKE IN SF RECENTLY (even thought it was oakland) and he was like WOW I'VE ONLY SEEN MUSE FIVE TIMES AND I LOVED BAD RELIGION WHEN I WAS LIKE 12, DID THEY PLAY 'SLUMBER' I LOVED THAT SONG and I was like I DUNNO NOT WHEN I WAS THERE cuz i'd missed the first like half of the show and then I was like WHEN I SAW MUSE THEY DIDN'T PLAY STOCKHOLM! DID YOU GUYS GET STOCKHOLM? and they were like WELL THEY DID THE ROULETTE THING SO WE GOT NEW BORN AGAIN (and i didn't figure out what they meant by again--did they play it twice lol? I'll look on the message boards later) and then his companion was like "here, you can have this" and gave me a 20 euro bill but on further inspection it was a 20 euro bill on plastic-y paper that says "the 2nd law" and has a picture of the band on it HAHAHAHA and they were like YEAH SOME CEO OF A BANK THREW THESE DOWN LIKE CONFETTI FROM THE CATWALK, YOU CAN HAVE THIS AS A SOUVENIR CUZ WE CAN SEE HOW SAD YOU ARE THAT YO MISSED THE SHOW and i was like THANK YOU

Then they told us about some interesting-sounding clubs (jazz // live music // different scenes // blues) and we went our separate ways. Ally and I danced a while. One fo the clubs played that song I used to play a lot in my dorm room in 2000 that goes "i just don't care if it something soemthing, I'll fly with youuuuuuuuuuuu! I'll fly with yyoooooouuuuuu" and then immediately after that, played that song by macklemore, the one that I like that isn't thrift shop--I like it because it's obviously tongue-in-cheek with the most generic-sounding lyrics possible for the impossibly catchy chorus -- tongiht is the night, this is the moment, we'll fight til it's over, so throw your hands up like the ceiling can't hold us...  I love this song and Leidesplein clubs do too. We went to another club and the song played there. Then we went to another bar and the song played there too. Hahaha.

Sarah and Estelle just got into town so I have to pack up here and go find them! So excited!
