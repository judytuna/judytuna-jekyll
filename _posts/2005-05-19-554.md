The internet is horrible WONDERFUL.

[http://www.livejournal.com/community/ucberkeley/916538.html](http://www.livejournal.com/community/ucberkeley/916538.html) … my god… i cannot tell you how engrossing this thread is. i absolutely cannot tell you. the post says: post a confession, and post it anonymously. and suddenly the community explodes in heartfelt anguish and warmth and sexiness and comfort and pain and it’s absolutely stunning. i cannot believe it. i read these threads and i think, “that’s exactly how i feel, i can’t believe i’m not alone” and read a billion posts replying “that’s exactly how i feel, you’re not alone” … amazing.

I could go on. [bearhoa](http://bearhoa.livejournal.com/) has joined the lightbringers, at least part-time 😉
