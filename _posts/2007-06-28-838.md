(written on monday, half-finished… i’m posting it now out of some sense of completistism)

there is so much to DO: http://community.livejournal.com/ucberkeley/2496076.html

jarring: getting in a car in hot, hot berkeley and emerging somewhere south of pacifica and north of half moon bay (montero?) and falling over. oh wind! you are so strong! oh sand, you are so pervasive! maybe there is still sand in my eye.

there were days

when a refrain

would brighten our corner

of hickory lane

so won’t you sing that song for me

the only one you know and i know now (not at the start)

we’re going to pieces

we’re falling apart

so won’t you sing that song for me
