I know a bot.
Her name is Anna.
Anna is her name.
She can ban you, 
ban you so hard.
She cleans up our channel.
I want to tell you:
I know a bot.

Yes, this is from last year, but I just found out about him now. It is amazing. I am completely bewildered. WTF is going on? Giant DotA competition? Hot chicks clubbing? Sitting in a paddleboat singing about IRC bots?????????

So... catchy.

He should teach his hot chicks how to play DotA imo.
