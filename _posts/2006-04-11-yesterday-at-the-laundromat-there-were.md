Yesterday, at the laundromat, there were a bunch of really loud guys in cowboy hats yelling stuff about broncos and cowgirls and fighting and other tidbits such as "his girlfriend's ass is as wide as this laundromat, I wouldn't want to fuck her anyway." Alex said he heard their southern accents slip once, though, when they said "yeah, don's back at the dorm."

Weird.
