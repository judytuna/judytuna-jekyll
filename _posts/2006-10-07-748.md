-The random jumping. SO GOOD.

-That really was Goldshire, and the Arathi Highlands. /applause

-There was/were (I can’t decide. I really just sat here for five minutes vascillating between the two) no Horde because if they tried to explain that the game was about “Horde vs Alliance,” then nonplayers would be confused and not understand why “getting killed when all you want to do is pve” was such a big deal. The wisdom of Hoa: “That episode sums up the biggest debate in WoW. It sounded like all they were interested in was questing, but the actual episode was one long pvpfest.

3. I bought Hullabaloo (the CDs. If I want the DVD I’ll probably have to get it online; no stores carry it anymore.) I hope I win those tickets to London. The cha sao bao from [eastern bakery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/2RXWZrFy8nWrjmdS5KilrQ) were delicious. Soft, succulent, sweet. Delicious. I had two steamed ones; A had two baked ones. Next time I will get baked ones. The bakery had a very large picture on the wall of president clinton smiling and holding baos. The other patrons included a large group of elderly white women wearing copious amounts of eyeliner. They kept going back and forth on whether they wanted two or three dozen pork buns; ultimately they didn’t have enough cash on them to purchase three dozen.
