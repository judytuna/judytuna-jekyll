      <p>Yeah, occasionally.  I'm not really collecting anymore, nor playing seriously, but I have my cards already and play for fun sometimes.  Why?</p>

      <p>there's a WoW trading card game and while i've never known anything about magic or any trading card game at all in my life, by my sheer love of WoW i've become curious. also, some of my friends have gotten really into magic lately. also x 2, a bunch of my guildmates are into magic (one is ranked 6th in the state) and i was around them when they were talking about it. i spent some time at the trading card game section at blizzcon, where they had all these tournaments set up, but i didn't really watch the games or learn that much. however, i'm interested. so i was just asking cuz i thought i'd read something in your livejournal about magic tournaments before =) </p>
      <p>the burning crusade expansion to WoW came with two packs of cards, and one of the things in the blizzcon goodie bag was a whole starter's deck, so i'm shuffling through them. i got a warlock deck. warlocks are overpowered. haha. maybe i'll go to games of berkeley and play with them sometime, if it doesn't conflict with my raiding schedule. LOLOLOL</p>

      <p>Neat!  I've seen the WOW CCG, but never played it.  Yeah, I play Magic occasionally, but not competitively, and I really haven't focused too much on it in the past several years.</p>

my guildmates are awesome.

it was great. watching starcraft tournaments is so much fun. i really wanted nalra to win cuz savior's so full of himself, but alas. really loved the sound and music panel and the concert, oh, the video games live concert, i could have weeped for joy. lady sylvanas!!!!!!!!!!! at some point i'll post my videos.

played starcraft 2 of course, couldn't get that into it because we only got 20 minutes. at the panel, they showed us the storyline part of it, which is really rpg-like, an interesting new twist. the gameplay itself is very familiar, of course. wrath of the lich king... FROSTMOURNE HUNGERS!!! ...
