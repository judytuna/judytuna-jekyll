my guildmates are awesome.

it was great. watching starcraft tournaments is so much fun. i really wanted nalra to win cuz savior's so full of himself, but alas. really loved the sound and music panel and the concert, oh, the video games live concert, i could have weeped for joy. lady sylvanas!!!!!!!!!!! at some point i'll post my videos.

played starcraft 2 of course, couldn't get that into it because we only got 20 minutes. at the panel, they showed us the storyline part of it, which is really rpg-like, an interesting new twist. the gameplay itself is very familiar, of course. wrath of the lich king... FROSTMOURNE HUNGERS!!! ...
