      <p>I read your post this morning and didn't have anything to say about it until just now, when I added Dinosaur Comics to my LJ rss feed.</p>

      <p>hmm, i didn't know it was a recent trend started by something specific.  While I had to ask how "O Rly" came about, I never thought, "You're so big!"  "That's what she said" needed an explanation.  I  just thought it was always around.  Surely there's something more worthy of a day... how about "High Five Day"?</p>

People say this all the time (ok, in Warcraft) and I figured it was from something, I just didn't know what. I still don't know what, or why its popularity has resurfaced in the last two months.

Jumping on the International Talk Like A Pirate Day bandwagon, obviously.
