      <p>It looks like a crane fly; aka moskito hawk aka skeetereater. It is not a beetle, it's a fly. It is harmless unless you are obsessed with having a perfect lawn. It definitely doesn't sting, and possibly doesn't even have a mouth. The worst it can do is break its leg on you. </p>

      <p>You're amazing.</p>
      <p>Did you see how big it is though? What other people have told me were "mosk(qu?)ito hawks / skeetereaters" were a lot smaller.</p>
      <p>Want to come over and pet it? It's just chillin' there above my bed and has been for hours. It's way too big to fit in a plastic cup or bowl or tupperware and bring outside so I don't know what I'm going to do about it.</p>

      <p>The larvae burrow in the dirt and make the lawn die a bit. </p>

      <p>It's a crane fly/mosquitohawk. They're harmless.</p>

There is a giant bug in my room. Observe:

Bernie says it's harmless and a kind of beetle. Can you identify it for me? (This question is directed at the one who is most likely to be able to identify it, namely, Lisaur.)
