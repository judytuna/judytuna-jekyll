*Muse are rocking the two-tone colour scheme quite heavily. Dominic is wearing black and white brogue shoes and his black blazer with the white piping, and Matt is wearing an amazing black and cream frock coat, which you’ll have seen on the telly. He claims this is because he’s just seen ‘March Of The Penguins’ and liked it so much he wanted to be one.*
