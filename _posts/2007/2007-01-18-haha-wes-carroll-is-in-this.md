muse in sf on april 9 update
presale starts tomorrow at 10am: https://ticketing.concertmaps.com/muse/  <--this presale is run by muse?
another link to a different website to get tickets is here: http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1C003D87EBA6B67D?artistid=910029&majorcatid=10001&minorcatid=60 <--this presale is run by live105?

so apparently it&#039;ll be $35 and they say it&#039;ll be completely general admission. 3000 standing, 4000 seated
