I won a $25 gift certificate for singing a song about warcraft in line at EB games. (Actually I had to sing twice, since at first I tied for second place. My first song went “soon we will have it, the warcraft expansion, the blood elves, the draenei, and me” and my second went “somewhere beyond the dark portal…” yeah I’m not very creative. The singoff left me at 2nd place, but the 1st place winner (he rapped about the ghettos of tichondrius?) left already, so I got to claim the first place prize.)

And now,

hahahaha
