      <p>It's 7:6 odds on a 6/8 place bet. I usually start betting against the shooter when they get a point of 4 or 10, then usually end up sad. Then there's my strange habit of betting $5 on the field at random times and for some reason usually end up happy.</p>
      <p>Craps is a confusing game, but so very fun once you kinda understand it (and start winning), because the mood swings are so quick. Everyone's so so happy when the shooter hits his point, then when he rolls a 2/3/12 craps on the very next coming out roll everyone is so pissed at the shooter.</p>
      <p>Spot Vegas trip? :-P</p>

      <p>Yeah, on the car ride back to LA I figured it must have been 7:6 if the payout was "$14 to $12," right? </p>
      <p>I forgot to write in my post that we had a guy appear twice at our table who the dealers referred to as Bud Light because that's what he drank. So they'd yell "EEHHH BUD LIGHT, GOOD TO SEE YOU MAN!" and then because the dealers kept yelling it, he started yelling it, and he got everybody yelling "BUD LIGHT!" He was awesome. Someone else misunderstood and started yelling "BLUE LIGHT SPECIAL!" which just made everything even more awesome. </p>
      <p>Nick's played before, so all we did was stand there with him explaining everything to me for like the first half hour. haha. He usually plays pai gao poker, cuz your money can sit there for a really long time. Aside from craps, we didn't play anything else but 2 numbers on roulette on Monday, though... we were tired and wanted to get home and were also really poor. haha</p>
      <p>Yeah, Vegas seems like it'd be fun with a group. Rowdy drunkenness seeks company? I didn't even drink enough to get tipsy, which is almost disappointing in some way because that's what you're supposed to do at Vegas, right? Party? We were tired and dehydrated, though. Outdoor music festivals in the desert are exhausting. We had a glass of champagne each at sunday brunch, and we shared this extremely delicious bellini at lunch on monday. My boyfriend's such a woman. It's great.</p>

      <p>My friend Andrew, from school (his gf had Laura as an RA), was also at Vegoose and told me "wow, Muse... total rock stars. so ridiculusly talented. At one point in the set, they shone a light on his metallic guitar and it reflected on a plane flying by and everyone was all, 'WOOOOOO!'"  so yeah, now he's a fan.  hehe</p>

I'm sick.

I saw Daft Punk, Muse, and Rage Against the Machine at Vegoose this weekend. 

There are fewer things more ridiculous than a helmeted robot-man pumping a metallic fist at us from within a giant raised pyramid-spaceship, and therefore now I am a big fan of Daft Punk. Plus I love a good dance party. Their set was crazy: pyramid bordered with really bright pulsing moving lights and screens on the sides, triangle-latticework facade capable of rendering progressions of colors, big screen in the back largely used for words. I wish I got a picture of the part in "technologic" where they said "fuck it" for two stanzas and the back screen blinked "FUCK" in big big big red letters. That would have made a fantastic livejournal icon. In their encore, they surprised us with light-up suits and everybody cheered. It was awesome! Here are some pretty good pictures from someone on the Muse messageboards: http://board.muse.mu/showthread.php?p=3568459#post3568459

Muse delivered a top-notch performance, as usual. [Spidey Dom](http://board.muse.mu/showthread.php?p=3566237#post3566237)! Muse's set was minimal, and the setlist was very similar to the one we saw at Irvine, only shorter. At one point Matt stood in the spotlight with his mirror guitar and shone a beam of light at a passing airplane. That was cool. A lot of the crowd were there for Rage, but I heard a few positive comments in the sea of disinterest around me: "that's a lot of sound coming out of such a little guy," "wow they rock!"

Rage and Rage's crowd were both fun to watch. FUCK YOU I WON'T DO WHAT YOU TELL ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Here I am at the very back of Rage's crowd:

On Monday before we left, we played craps, because I've never gambled before. I am happy to report that after like an hour I was no longer completely confused. Just mostly confused. I had a little fun run as the shooter. I kept putting 5 on hard six when I was rolling for some reason. Once I put down 5 on hard six and then immediately rolled an easy six, QQed, and then four rolls later I rolled a hard six and the people around me QQed some more--"if you just put down that bet one turn later!" A nice old guy next to us who explained some stuff ("the odds on those areas (6 and 8) are something like 4 to 7, i don't remember what they are exactly but you want to bet in multiples of 6. if you put down 10, the payout will only be 10, but if you put down 12, the payout will be 14. so if you're gonna put down on six and eight, put down 12!") put a 5 on hard six for me, and I immediately proceeded to roll a 7. That made me QQ. Gambling is kind of pointless if you are very indecisive and don't know what's going on. Haha. 

Man... I never take enough pictures!
