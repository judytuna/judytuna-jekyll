      <p>Inconvenient misreading</p>
      <p>You should leave the newspapers down if you're going to shit on your front porch, at least until you're finished--then you can pick them up!</p>

just now, i felt something on my arm, so i shook it. something solid landed on the desk. it was a spider. i cleaned up the newspapers and shit on my front porch the other day and foolishly put them in my paper-recycling brown bag in my room for a few days. i must have brought this spider in then. i'm vacuuming my room now. goodbye.
