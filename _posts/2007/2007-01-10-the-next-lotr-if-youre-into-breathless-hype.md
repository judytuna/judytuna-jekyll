It's time for a Golden Compass update.

The main site is up. http://www.goldencompassmovie.com/
It's really nice. In a moment I'm going to look in the books for some combinations and figure out the "exclusive content" hidden in the alethiometer.

Daniel Craig interview in the Observer: http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,,1980421,00.html
Talks about learning to deal with fame, really wants us to know that they're not dumbing down the material for the film. Comes off as a bit cocky in that "I'm a really hot movie star and you'll love me all the more for it" way.

Dakota Blue Richards interview in Newsweek: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16240580/site/newsweek/
Cute interview of little substance, alas.

Magazine pictures of Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig: http://www.style.com/w/feat_story/010307/popup/slideshow8.html
Hot. I wish there were more. Of them in bed.
Speaking of beds, [Eva Green](http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0381061/Ss/0381061/r_14444_rV4.jpg.html?hint=nm0185819), by the way, is playing Serafina Pekkala. At least she's not blond for the movie. I'm still not done QQing over Mrs. Coulter being blond.

And of course, lol beard:

Like the rest of the world, ever since I saw Casino Royale. Which was only a few days ago.

He's such a pouter. Just give me a killer pout and suspenders, that's all it takes. And completely gratuitous shots of coming out of the ocean in a speedo several times.

I simply cannot wait for this movie to come out. It's going to be beautiful. Ryan The Naysayer says "it's going to be terrible" [edit: After viewing the website, Ryan The True Believer says "That movie looks really good. It makes me want to live there and leave this world behind"] but I like beautiful things and beautiful is enough for me. Even so, no, I have faith in Mr. Pullman, and New Line, and these really hot people, and the power of this story.

Easily my favorite picture:

They've renamed the armoured bears "ice bears" but still call them panserbjorne. The concept armor looks different that I'd imagined it... I hope the animation turns out top-notch. Nobody's seen the deamons yet. How exciting!

Time to start making lj icons. http://bridgetothestars.net/movie/images/stills/
