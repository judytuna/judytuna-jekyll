who wants to go to vegas for my birthday? i want to see muse and making a trip out of it to vegas sounds like more fun than going to the irvine or san diego dates. BUT.... the vegas one is just [a festival performance](http://www.vegoose.com) (though there are many other bands to see of course), while the irvine and san diego ones are full concerts... i should get a job so i can purchase plane tickets
