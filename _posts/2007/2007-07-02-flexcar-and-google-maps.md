The Flexcar website uses Mapquest. It is sub-optimal. So, instead of going to the store to buy a mop and drano and food to eat, I made my own Google saved map of the Flexcars in Berkeley. 

http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&om=1&msa=0&msid=109366388378158015978.000434542906e651465d1

It’s not a mashup, since I just did it manually, tabbing back and forth from Flexcar’s list. http://www.flexcar.com/default.aspx?tabid=216

I don’t know how to make a real mashup (that would take the information from the Flexcar website and do it all automatically). Regardless, I’m pretty proud of myself.
