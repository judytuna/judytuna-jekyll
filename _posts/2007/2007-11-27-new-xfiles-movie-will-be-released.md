New x-files movie will be released July 25, 2008, with filming starting Dec. 10 in Vancouver. I know this from the ancient, ancient, ancient [xf-news] yahoo group and from http://www.xfilesnews.com , which has a link to the haven for the fbi's most unwanted and the gossamer archive and stuff, which I didn't know still existed. X-philes are a tenacious sort.
