just now, i felt something on my arm, so i shook it. something solid landed on the desk. it was a spider. i cleaned up the newspapers and shit on my front porch the other day and foolishly put them in my paper-recycling brown bag in my room for a few days. i must have brought this spider in then. iâ€™m vacuuming my room now. goodbye.
