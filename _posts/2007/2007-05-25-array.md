      <p>HAHAHAAH! Some out-of-context quotes which I find funny from <a href="http://judy.sourceforge.net/doc/10minutes.htm" rel="nofollow">a 10-minute description of how Judy arrays work...</a></p>
      <p>"What makes Judy so fast?"<br />
      "Judy is designed to avoid cache-line fills wherever possible. (This is the main design criteria for Judy.)"<br />
      "In practice, Judy does much better than this."<br />
      "In a 64-bit Judy, it would probably require more RAM than exists on this planet to get it to have 8 levels."<br />
      "Judy adapts efficiently to a wide range of populations and data set densities."<br />
      "Well I cannot describe Judy in 10 minutes -- what possessed me?"</p>
      <p>The world needs more 64-bit Judy's.</p>
      <p>Now I'm trying to figure out how I can use Judy's at work.... I never knew you were so optimized for cache locality.</p>

      <p>I agree.  And yay for cache locality!</p>
