      <p>It's cool!  Just roll a blood elf to level 18 and you can get the quest to go to UC.  But... she doesn't so much sing as direct a coir of banshees to sing ahahaha.</p>

AKA what happens at 5am in Ironforge. Some of us in the guild sing and play guitar, so there'll be an audio version soon, I'm sure.

hey there sylvanas
what's it like in undercity
i'm a thousand zones away
but girl tonight you look so pretty yes you do
terrace of light can't shine as bright as you
i swear it's true

hey there sylvanas
don't you worry about the distance
i'll hearth right there if you get lonely
give this song another listen, close your eyes
read my emotes they're my disguise
i'm on your side

oh it's what you do to me oh it's what you do to me

hey there sylvanas
i know content's getting hard
but just believe me girl someday
i'll slay arthas on this gamecard
we'll have it good
we'll get the loot we knew we would
my rolls are good

hey there sylvanas i've got so much time left to play
if every simple quest i did for you
would take your breathbar away
i'd complete them all
i'd ride all the way to hammerfall
i'd free thrall

oh it's what you do to me oh it's what you do to me

a thousand zones seems pretty far
but they've got rams from anvilmar
i'd autorun to you if i had no other way
the noobs would all make fun of us
but we'll just laugh along because
we know that none of them know how to play
sylvanas i can promise you
that by the time that we get through
the world of warcraft will never be the same
and you're to blame

hey there sylvanas
you be good and don't you miss me
two more years and i won't be done with school but i'll be top of armory
like i do
you know if it weren't for you
i'd have time to do whatever i want to
hey there sylvanas here's to you
there's still wow 2....

oh it's what you do to me
oh it's what you do to me...
