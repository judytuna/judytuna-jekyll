AKA what happens at 5am in Ironforge. Some of us in the guild sing and play guitar, so there’ll be an audio version soon, I’m sure.

hey there sylvanas

what’s it like in undercity

i’m a thousand zones away

but girl tonight you look so pretty yes you do

terrace of light can’t shine as bright as you

i swear it’s true

hey there sylvanas

don’t you worry about the distance

i’ll hearth right there if you get lonely

give this song another listen, close your eyes

read my emotes they’re my disguise

i’m on your side

oh it’s what you do to me oh it’s what you do to me

hey there sylvanas

i know content’s getting hard

but just believe me girl someday

i’ll slay arthas on this gamecard

we’ll have it good

we’ll get the loot we knew we would

my rolls are good

hey there sylvanas i’ve got so much time left to play

if every simple quest i did for you

would take your breathbar away

i’d complete them all

i’d ride all the way to hammerfall

i’d free thrall

oh it’s what you do to me oh it’s what you do to me

a thousand zones seems pretty far

but they’ve got rams from anvilmar

i’d autorun to you if i had no other way

the noobs would all make fun of us

but we’ll just laugh along because

we know that none of them know how to play

sylvanas i can promise you

that by the time that we get through

the world of warcraft will never be the same

and you’re to blame

hey there sylvanas

you be good and don’t you miss me

two more years and i won’t be done with school but i’ll be top of armory

like i do

you know if it weren’t for you

i’d have time to do whatever i want to

hey there sylvanas here’s to you

there’s still wow 2….

oh it’s what you do to me

oh it’s what you do to me…
