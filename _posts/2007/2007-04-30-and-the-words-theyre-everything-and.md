and the words, they're everything and nothing.
i want to search for her in the offhand remarks:
who are you, taking coffee, no sugar?
who are you, echoing street signs?
who are you, stranger in the shell of a lover?
dark curtains drawn by the passage of time.
oh words, like rain, how sweet the sound...
well anyway, 
she says,
i'll see you around.
