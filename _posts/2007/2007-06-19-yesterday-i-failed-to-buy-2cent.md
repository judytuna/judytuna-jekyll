      <p>Sounds like you succeeded in a morning bird- and pastry-watching walk! </p>
      <p>Love, the department for the dissemmination of half-full glasses. </p>
      <p>PS: Essendorf's 363rd law states that the library will always be closed when you go there with a specific purpose. Only seekers who will be content with whatever book the library gods choose are permitted to enter. </p>

      <p>It is true. I went back later today, after I got the name of the book, and their only copy was checked out, so again I left empty-handed. OH THE WOE</p>

      <p>It is much like going to a Japanese restaurant.  If you REALLY want to go, it will be closed.</p>

      <p>Dude! At least you remembered that two cent stamps were necessary. I just got some mail returned with insufficient postage. DURN!</p>

      <p>I have extra 1-cent stamps! The vending machine at the post office that had 2-cent stamps in stock was broken, so I had to use the other vending machine, which only had 1-cent stamps in booklets of 50! I only needed 17*2=34 of them! Would you like me to bring a quantity that is an even number for you??</p>

      <p>O Lisaur, </p>
      <p>I remembered to bring them to our last rehearsal, but I forgot that I'd brunged 'em. Remind me?</p>

      <p>they have taken mine away</p>
      <p>My library, she is more than closed before 10, she is gone utterly!</p>
      <p>I had some time to kill getting up to Spot rehearsal from work (ETA straight from work to 19th St BART being 6:20, a wholly unacceptably early time to get there for an 8pm rehearsal, it's bad enough for my usual 7pm improv rehearsals), so I figured I would get off the CalTrain at Hillsdale (the station nearest us) and pop down to the Hillsdale branch of the library which is about halfway between the station and home and maybe find a book or so but lo! it was vanished quite away.</p>
      <p>And I got a Tazo raspberry/apple tea from Whole Foods and it sadly confirmed my suspicions that it would be not what I was looking to drink, especially at $1.25.  Nasssty over-sweet hobbitses we hates it forever.</p>
      <p>I blame the Powers that Be for blowing their wad souping up the downtown branch...grr.  Smaller libraries in more locations, not fewer bigger ones!</p>
      <p>Maybe it has just hidden itself away somewhere nearby.</p>

Yesterday I failed to buy 2-cent stamps because I left my house for the post office at 5 'til 5. Today I failed to get a science fiction book I've been meaning to read because 1) I forgot its name and 2) the berkeley public library (which I haven't stepped inside of since 2002?) doesn't open 'til 10. I watched a hummingbird dart between purple white blooms. It's so grey outside and there was no sunlight to make the bird's coat a lustrous green: they're so brown in the fog. Buggers (term of endearment) sure go fast, though. Hummingbirds must consume a lot of energy. They must be incredibly efficient. Maybe it does not take that much energy to turn nectar into power (like it does to turn bamboo into usable calories). Walking on Shattuck before 9am between Cedar and Rose is pretty funny: people bearing Starbucks cups travelling north, and people bearing cheeseboard pastries travelling south. I have safely ensconced in my unmarked brown paper bag one chocolate thing and one brioche. "Don't post signs: we have alerted the police" in red text on cha-ya's window, and so I've had "all the scars on your skin: post no bills" ... "for the holes in our soles host no thrills" going 'round and 'round in my head for a while. whoooooo yooooooou weeerrrreeeeeee was so beaoooooooooooooooooootifulllllllllll
