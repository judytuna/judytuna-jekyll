look at that setlist. microcuts... /wish

just now i took a nap and dreamed that muse was staying at my house in san jose. i showed matt a picture from http://community.livejournal.com/musewhores/140970.html#cutid1 of the stadium filling up before the show (that thread was awesome, got updated with pictures as the hours went on; i'd checked it right before my nap), and dom let my dad drive their car.
