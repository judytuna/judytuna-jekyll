      <p>Oh!  It was a Popscene show you went to!  I *heart* Popscene.  It's the best club night in the known universe, as far as I can tell.</p>

      <p>I've never been to popscene, even though I've heard about it since I was a freshman in the dorms (since it's 18+). Actually, I went to popscene once in 2004 to try to see Muse, but we couldn't get in the door and we tried to watch Muse's set through a window. Best club night in the known universe? Geez, I have to go check it out someday.</p>
      <p>Popscene is a um, club, right? Somewhere in SF, far away from bart? Is it also a, like, entity that organizes things? I'm confused. The show I went to wasn't AT Popscene... it was at a really scary place on sixth street between market and mission, which made it really easy to bart to, but I was still scared.</p>

      <p>Popscene is a club night.  It used to be over by the...baseball stadium...the new one...PacBell Park?  Whatever it's called now.  But that was its new home and I think for awhile it was rotating around at different clubs.</p>
      <p>Yes, it's also an entity that organizes things.  Cool things.  Indie rock and Britpop things.</p>
