MY HEAD HURTS SO MUCH AUUUUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
i've been popping tylenol sinus congestion & pain gelcaps. 325 mg acetaminophen, 5mg phenylephrine HCl. do you have any other recommendations?
it's a sharp, sharp, horrible pain behind my eye, extending through my nose down to my teeth, and sometimes pops in my temple. tendrils of it touch that gland behind my jaw. it does not throb. it does not abate. (cessate is not a word.) (i just realized that cease is probably the word i was looking for; cease --> cessation?) i don't want to look at anything or stand up.
oh yeah and my jaws hurt. not where they usually hurt, which is underneath the jaws, by my throat, but up in my cheek. opening my mouth causes discomfort. they started hurting tuesday evening, when i got my most recent cavities filled, and the pain has steadily gotten worse. it's not gums, mind you; the dentistry is fine... it's the jaw. i feel that i am holding stress in my jaw.
