Hello. This is a document written in Google Docs & Spreadsheets.
 Now I'm trying out the formatting. 
And seeing how often it autosaves. Pretty often, it seems.
> This is in a quote box. Clicking on the quote box makes it so that the entire paragraph your cursor is on becomes a quote. I can't seem to figure out how to get out of a quote box once you're typing in it, though, if it's at the end of your document.Pressing enter extends the quote box.

Palatino Linotype

Right-to-left formatting whatever that means. What? All the punctuation marks go to the left before popping back to the right How strange....

Now this is a normal paragraph.

There's an inserted image.

It would have been more exciting had I imported a spreadsheet instead. Maybe later.
