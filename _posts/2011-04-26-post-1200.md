I have been using both [xmarks](http://www.xmarks.com/) and [Firefox Sync](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-sync/) to keep track of my Firefox bookmarks across different computers, but haphazardly. Last week I noticed my bookmarks weren’t synced. Do I need to choose between them?

[This blog post from June 2010](http://burndive.blogspot.com/2010/06/firefox-sync-vs-xmarks.html) is about using both simultaneously. The post goes over how Firefox Sync encrypts the bookmark data before sending to the server (so if the server is compromised, no one can do anything with that data) whereas xmarks does not (so that xmarks can do stuff like recommendations). I confess that I have ACTUALLY USED the recommendations to look for Ruby tutorials. Oh no, I’m justifying data mining!

[Here’s a thread from March 2011](http://forums.lastpass.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=62839) about xmarks/lastpass vs. google sync. The poster says she uses lastpass for the “log in to all websites” feature.

I never set up xmarks with other browsers, because I don’t use them much (and when I do, it’s to log in to stuff with different user accounts). I never used the “log in at once to everything” feature of lastpass (because I figured it wasn’t “secure”), but I must admit that it sounds attractive, and maybe it isn’t actually any less secure than just typing in all my passwords over and over again every time I open my browser. Any advice?

Maybe I’ll use Chrome with google sync for my LoL podcast logins, and Firefox for personal use. xP
