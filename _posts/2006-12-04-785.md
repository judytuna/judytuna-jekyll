Muse just had a press conference: theyâ€™re the first musical act announced to play at the newly reopened [Wembley Stadium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium) hooray! Now someone buy me a plane ticket to england next June =( I bet the stage setup is going to be incredible. And how cool would it be if they got another Glastonbury headline slot! haa
