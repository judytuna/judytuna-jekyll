I am obsessed with this album. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Heroine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Heroine)

There are so many gems in the lyrics. They all break my heart. I love the way “I’m kinda tired of being told to throw my hands up in the air, so there” is old and young and something about her voice, her voice, her voice.

I can’t stop listening to [Buzzcut Season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNDeRBpNn5s). The octave piano on the off-beat already feels like an old friend. 

I am so heartbroken by this song. Here are the lyrics I hear. I looked them up after I typed them out. What I hear (recorded below) is slightly wrong, indicated by corrections in brackets for no really good reason other than I think it’s kind of entertaining to write down what I thought the lyrics were before I knew what they are in canon.

I remember when your head caught flame.

It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain.

(I remember when your head caught flame.)

Well, you left. Baby, it’s okay. [Actual lyric: “‘Well,’ you laughed, ‘baby it’s okay'”]

It’s buzzcut season anyway.

(Well you left. Baby, it’s okay.)

Explosions on tv, and all the girls with heads inside a dream.

So now we live beside the pool, where everything is good.

We ride the bus with the knees pulled in.

People should see how we’re living.

(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in.)

Shut my eyes to the song that plaaaays. (that plaaays.)

Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste.

(Shut my eyes to the song that plays.)

The men up on the news, they try to tell us all that we will lose,

but it’s so easy, in this blue, where everything is good.

And I’ll never go home again.

Place the call, feel it start, favorite friend.

And nothing’s wrong, but nothing’s true: [Actual lyric: “nothing’s wrong when nothing’s true”]

I live in a hologram with you. 

Where all the things that we do for fun [Actual lyric: “We’re all the things that we do for fun”]

cannot be, let it go, [Actual lyric: “And I’ll breathe, and it goes”]

play along, make-believe, it’s hyper-real

but I live in a hologram with you. 

The cold earth, the burnt-out taste; [Actual lyric: “The cola, the burnt-out taste”]

I’m the one you tell your fears to.

There’ll never be enough of us.

Explo-

sions on

tv, and all the girls with heads

inside

a dream

so now we live

beside

the pool

where everything is good 

And i’ll never go home again

place the call, feel it start, favorite friend

And nothing’s wrong but nothing’s true

i live in a hologram with you 

where all the things that we do for fun

cannot be, let it go,

play along, make-believe, it’s hyper-real

but I live in a hologram with you.
